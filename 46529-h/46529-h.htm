such as found out musical tunes, and recited verses in writing:
rich men furnished with ability, living peaceably in their habitations:

<p>'I do much admire that these times have so little esteemed
the vertues of the times, as that the writing of <em>Lives</em> should be
no more frequent. For although there be not many soveraign
princes, or absolute commanders, and that states are most collected
into monarchies; yet are there many worthy personages
that deserve better than dispersed report, or barren elogies; for
herein the invention of one of the late poets is proper, and
doth well inrich the ancient fiction. For he faineth, that at
the end of the thread or web of every man's life, there was a
little medal containing the person's name; and that <em>Time</em>
waiteth upon the <em>Sheers</em>, and as soon as the thread was cut,
caught the medals, and carried them to the river <em>Lethe</em>; and
about the bank there were many birds flying up and down, and
would get the medals, and carry them in their beak a little
while, and then let them fall into the river. Onely there were a
few <em>Swans</em>, which if they got a name, would carry it to a
temple where it was consecrate.'</p>

<p>'It is a melancholy reflection to look back on so many great
families as have formerly adorned the county of Cornwall, and
are now no more: the Grenvilles, the Arundells, Carminows,
Champernons, Bodrugans, Mohuns, Killegrews, Bevilles, Trevarions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
which had great sway and possessions in these parts.
The most lasting families have only their seasons, more or less,
of a certain constitutional strength. They have their spring
and summer sunshine glare, their wane, decline, and death:
they flourish and shine perhaps for ages;&mdash;at last they sicken;
their light grows pale, and, at a crisis when the off-sets are
withered and the old stock is blasted, the whole tribe disappears,
and leave the world as they have done Cornwall.
There are limits ordained to everything under the sun: <em>man
will not abide in honour</em>.'</p>

shrewd humour, are slight and incomplete; and Fuller,
of course, is now out of date: indeed, most of the
Cornishmen whose names will be found in the following
pages lived since his time. The Rev. R. Polwhele, of
Polwhele, one of the historians of his native county,
has certainly left us some amusing notices in his
'Biographical Sketches;' but out of the sixty names
that he enumerates, 'all-eating Time hath left us
but a little morsel (for manners) of their memories;'
and some half-dozen only seem to be sufficiently
distinguished to require any further perpetuation of
their fame than has been already conferred upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
them by Polwhele's now scarce little work. Besides
which, Polwhele, of course, had not access to the great
Libraries and Collections which are now available in
London, nor to the Transactions of many metropolitan
and local Archæological Societies; he was, moreover,
apt to be dazzled by the nearness of the effulgence
of some of his characters:&mdash;and he, too, is now
sixty or seventy years behind the time. Lastly,
neither Fuller nor Polwhele had the advantage of
the labours of those indefatigable pioneers in Cornish
literature&mdash;the authors of the 'Bibliotheca Cornubiensis.'<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Another recent work, invaluable to the
would-be biographer of Cornwall's Worthies is the
admirable history of Exeter College, Oxford, contained
in the Register of the Rectors, Fellows, etc., by my old
schoolfellow, the Rev. C. W. Boase, Fellow and Tutor
of that College (Oxford, 1879). If it should be said
that copious and complete biographies of one or two
of my characters have already been written, I would
venture to observe in reply, that these are <em>monograph</em>
accounts only; in some cases consisting of two or
three volumes, and now either out of print, or, from
their bulk and cost, not generally accessible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
May I allege another and a chief reason for writing
this work? It is, that I thought those persons
were right who considered the celebrities of my
native county had not received the notice which
they deserved. And yet, 'class for class,' says a
writer in the <cite>Times</cite>, 28th March, 1882, 'they will
beat all England.' Indeed (and I confess it with no
little shame) some of those whose lives I have endeavoured
to describe in the following pages, I did
not myself, at one time, know to have been Cornishmen!
And this although, as a Cornishman, I ought
not to be altogether without the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genius loci</i> of our
southernmost and westernmost county: yet&mdash;</p>

<p class="pfs90">
'Semper honos, nomenque horum, laudesque manebunt.'<br />
</p>

<p>As regards the principle on which the lives have
been selected of those who, amongst others, have been
worthiest 'in arms, in arts, in song,' I may say that
I have endeavoured to find such names as would be,
in the first place, of sufficient importance to warrant
their claims to notice being brought before the
public; secondly, to make the selection as varied in
character as possible; and, thirdly, to choose such
as were likely to prove interesting to the general
reader: for even biography itself&mdash;said by Librarians
to be one of the most popular branches of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles
lettres</i>&mdash;must prove uninteresting if dull subjects are
dully treated. I earnestly trust that I have not fallen
into this fatal error.</p>

<p>It might have been interesting to have said something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
of many mighty names of the past; even though
numbers of them are scarcely more than legendary.
Amongst others, of St. Ursula in the fourth century,
'daughter of the Cornish King Dionutus,' and
Directress of the celebrated expedition of the 'eleven
thousand virgins' to Cologne; of King Arthur himself;
of Walter de Constantiis, Chancellor of England,
and Chief Justice, in the twelfth century; of Thomas,
and St. George, and Richard, and Godfrey, of Cornwall;
of Odo de Tregarrick in Roche; of Simon
de Thurway; of John de Trevisa,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the fourteenth-century
scholar and divine, who was supposed to
have translated part of the Bible into English; ('a
daring work,' as Fuller says, 'for a private person in
that age without particular command from Pope or
Public Council'); and of that Syr Roger Wallyoborow,
of Buryan, who, in the time of Henry VIII.,
'miraculously brought home from the Holy Land a
piece of the true Cross.' There are, besides, many
others of later date, whose names I should have
liked, but for the reasons already given, to include;
such as the Bonythons;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the Carews; Sir John
Eliot, the Patriot; Dean Miller; the Molesworths;
the Edgcumbes of Mount Edgcumbe; Noy, Charles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>I.'s Attorney-General; Dean Prideaux; the Rashleighs;
the Robarteses; the Trelawnys; the Tremaynes;
and the Trevanions;&mdash;beside those whose
loss to Cornwall Dr. Borlase lamented; and many
others.</p>

<p>But there were few reliable materials for the first-named
group: authentic accounts of the deeds of
the legendary ancients have faded away into the
'dark backward and abysm of time;' and mere
legends it was hardly worth while to perpetuate.
Nor did it seem desirable to include a bare list of
names, or repetitions of lives of a generally similar
character; in which case the actors' names would
often have been the chief variations in what was
intended to be a readable, fireside book. In short,
I have aimed at making my list representative rather
than exhaustive.</p>

<p>With the object of not wearying the general
reader, I have refrained from clouding my pages
with minute references to authorities,&mdash;except when
some special reason seemed to occur for doing so.
I trust this will not be considered a defect, when
I state that, for some of the lives which follow, the
lists of authorities consulted would have occupied
nearly one fourth of the space allotted to the lives
themselves. As an instance, the number of entries
given in the 'Bibliotheca Cornubiensis' for the Killigrews
is 450; and one of these entries alone comprises
nearly fifty items.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span></p>

<p>A most pleasing task remains to be discharged;
namely, to record my heartfelt obligations to my
friends, the Rev. F. C. Hingeston-Randolph, M.A.,
and Mr. H. Michell Whitley, C.E., for their very
valuable assistance in seeing the following pages
through the press.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I will only add, in the words of that delightful
biographer, Izaak Walton, in his 'Life of George
Herbert':</p>

<p>'I have used very great diligence to inform myself,
that I might inform my reader of the truth of what
follows; and, though I cannot adorn it with eloquence,
yet I will do it with sincerity.'</p>

<p class="drop-capi2"><span class="smcap">St. Blazey Highway</span>
 has a clear title
to being the birthplace of Ralph Allen;
but his parentage is doubtful, owing to
his name not appearing in the baptismal
register, and to the obscurity caused by the two
following entries in the Register of Marriages:</p>

<div class="small">
<p class="center">1686.</p>
<p>William All&mdash;&mdash;, and Grace &mdash;&mdash;, was mar&mdash;&mdash; 24th August (entry<br />
imperfect).</p>

<p class="center">1687.</p>
<p>John Allen, of parish of St. Blazey, and Mary Elliott,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of the<br />
parish of St. Austell, were married the 10th of February.</p>
</div>

<p>Ralph was born about 1694. His father kept a
small inn called 'The Duke William'&mdash;sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>'The Old Duke'&mdash;(the site of which is now occupied
by three or four dwelling-houses), and he seems to
have been a man of good common-sense and sturdy
disposition, judging from one or two slight anecdotes
of him which have come down to us: doubtless
he gave his boy Ralph good advice, if not much
literary instruction. But the youngster primarily
owed most of his remarkable success in life to the
fact of his happening to be staying with his grandmother,
who kept the St. Columb Post-office, when
the Government Inspector came his rounds. This
officer seems to have at once recognised the shrewdness
and neat-handedness of the lad; and an appointment
in the Post-office at Bath, to which place young
Ralph was brought under the care of Sir John
Trevelyan, was, before long, offered to him. Here
he soon distinguished himself by detecting a plot to
introduce into Bath illegally, in connexion with the
Jacobite rising of 1715, a quantity of arms. This
discovery he forthwith communicated to General
Wade, who thereupon became his friend and patron,
and whose natural daughter&mdash;so Pierce Egan tells us&mdash;a
Miss Earl, became Allen's first wife. His first
wife, but not his first love: her he magnanimously
portioned, and yielded up to another man, with whom
he thought she might be happier; and hence, probably,
the reason why the basso-relievo of Scipio's resignation
of his captive was selected as one of the
principal decorations of the Hall at Prior Park. Farington
thus refers to Allen's discovery of the Jacobite
plot: 'When the rebellion burst out, a numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
junto in Bath took most active measures to aid the
insurrection in the West of England; and Mr. Carte,
the minister of the Abbey Church, <em>when Allen detected
the plot</em>, was glad to escape from the constables by
leaping from a window in full canonicals.'</p>

<p>On his becoming Deputy Postmaster at Bath, the
anomalies and inconveniences attendant upon the
postal system, as it was then worked, engaged
Allen's serious attention. It will scarcely be believed
that in those days a letter from Cheltenham
or Bath to Worcester or Birmingham was actually
sent first to London! To remedy this state of things
Allen by degrees perfected that scheme of cross-posts
throughout England and Wales with which his name
will always be associated, and for which he was
himself the contractor for many years; viz. from
1720 to 1764.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Accounts differ as to the profits
which accrued to him under this contract, which was
from time to time renewed; but there is no reason to
doubt the story that ultimately he cleared by it no
less a sum than half a million sterling.</p>

<p>In 1644, by a Resolution of the House of Commons,
Edmund Prideaux, a Member of the House, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
constituted Master of the Post Messengers and
Carriers, and in 1649 he established a weekly conveyance
to every part of the kingdom, in lieu of the
former practice under which letters were sent by
special messengers whose duty it was to supply relays
of horses at a certain mileage. In 1658 Cromwell
made Prideaux one of his Baronets; and he acquired
great wealth. It is said that his emoluments in
connexion with the Post Office were not less than
£15,000 a year. (Maclean's Trigg Minor, vol. ii.
pp. 210-11.) Thus, whilst to one West-countryman,
who, if not indeed a Cornishman by birth (for the
Prideauxes were lords of Prideaux, close to Allen's
birth-place), was at least of Cornish extraction&mdash;Postmaster-General
Edmund Prideaux, Attorney-General&mdash;we
owe in a great measure the regular
efficient establishment of the Post Office and its first
becoming a source of revenue&mdash;to another Cornishman,
the subject of these remarks, we are indebted
for the important improvements referred to above.</p>

<p>In the Home Office Papers, 1761 (2nd and 5th
December, Post Office Pl. 5, 385&mdash;'By-way and
Cross-road Posts'), will be found 'a narrative of
Mr. Allen's transactions with the Government for
the better management of the by-way and cross-road
posts from the year 1720 to the year 1762,
whereby it will be seen how much he has been the
instrument of increasing the revenue and encouraging
the commerce of this kingdom during the whole of
that long interval. Dated 2nd December, 1761.'
The narrative shows that in 1710 the country postmasters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
collected quantities of 'by or way letters,'
and clandestinely conveyed them. Correspondence
was perpetually interrupted. 'The by and way
letters were thrown promiscuously together into one
large bag, which was to be opened at every stage by
the deputy, or any inferior servant of the house, to
pick out of the whole heap what might belong to his
own delivery, and the rest put back again into this
large bag with such by-letters as he should have to
send to distant places from his own stage.' Traders
resorted to clandestine conveyance for speed. Surveyors
were, however, appointed to make reports on
the Post Office at the beginning of the reign of George
I., but their reports did not touch these by-letters. Mr.
Allen, having contrived checks which detected considerable
frauds, next formed the plan for the conveyance
of these letters in 1710. His offer to advance the
revenue of the Post Office from £4,000 to £6,000 a
year was accepted; but false and malicious representations
were made against his proposal. On an inquiry
as to the revenue from these letters, it was found that
for seven years it had sunk £900 a year. He then made
another proposal to farm the postage for seven years
at the sum which they then yielded, taking any such
surplus as he could make them produce, and an 'explanatory
contract' was then agreed to. On an
examination into the account of the country letters,
it had increased £7,835 2s. 7d., which Mr. Allen
would have been entitled to if the 'explanatory contract'
had only been executed. The country letters
increased to £17,464 4s. 11d. per annum at the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of fourteen years. He now appointed surveyors, and
stated his plans for suppressing irregularities. Lord
Lovell and Mr. Carteret having expressed their approval
of these plans, etc., he agreed to another contract
for seven years, and proposed an extension and
quickening of the correspondence in 1741 by an
'every-day post' to several places; this contract was
renewed in 1748, 1755, and 1760. It details the communications
by cross-roads, etc.; and it was found
that the revenue, by computation, had increased
one and a half millions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some fine quarries on Combe Down, from which
most of the best houses in Bath were built, having
become his property, Allen invented an ingenious
contrivance for conveying the huge blocks of stone from
the quarries on the hill down to the canal which runs by
the city. In his capacity of quarry-owner he amassed
still more wealth, became a large employer of labour,
and a man of such influence in Bath, that although
he was mayor once only (in 1742), he practically
guided the affairs of that city as it pleased him best,
a circumstance which gave rise to a caricature, long
popular at Bath, entitled 'The One-headed Corporation.'
It need hardly be added whose head that was.
A bust of him in the Drawing-room or Council
Chamber of the Guildhall commemorates the year
of his mayoralty, and there is also a portrait of him
in the Mayor's Room.</p>

<p>Probably his energies as a man of business were
exerted in many other directions, which it would
now be difficult to trace. But, be this as it may,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
he now determined on leaving his old residence in
the city, situated between York Street and Liliput
Alley, and which, I believe, still stands, though
obscured by surrounding buildings. The site he
chose for his long-planned new residence is one of
the finest in the kingdom. It is three or four miles
out of Bath, on the south-east side, and stands near
the Combe Down quarries, 400 feet above the sea,
commanding fine views over many a mile around.
Here at Prior Park, originally the seat of an old
monastic establishment, which, Leland says, 'belonged
to the prior of Bathe,'<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Ralph Allen determined
on building a large and stately mansion,
which should enable him to exercise a princely
hospitality towards almost every stranger of rank,
learning, or distinction who visited 'The Bath.'
Hither came, for instance, Thomson and Swift and
Gay, Arbuthnot and Pope, Sterne and Smollett,
Garrick and Quin; Graves, the author of the
'Spiritual Quixote'; and Charles Yorke, afterwards
Solicitor-General&mdash;all probably known to Allen
through meeting him in the literary circles of London,
which Allen frequented when he went to town.
Nor was he unvisited by royalty: the Princess
Amelia stayed there in 1752, and the Duke of York,
'on his own motion,' as Allen is careful to say, on
26th December, 1761. Here, too, might often be
found reckless, delightful, generous Henry Fielding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
who avowedly not only drew one phase of his munificent
friend's portrait as the somewhat too feeble
Squire Allworthy in 'Tom Jones,' and described the
mansion at Prior Park in the same novel, but also
dedicated to him that other story which Dr. Johnson
read with such avidity&mdash;'Amelia.' No doubt, too, it
is to Allen that Fielding refers in the well-known
passage in 'Joseph Andrews,' comparing him to the
'Man of Ross:' 'One Al&mdash;Al&mdash;&mdash; I forget his name.'
And Allen's generosity towards Fielding did not end
with cheery welcomes to Prior Park and timely loans&mdash;should
we not rather say gifts?&mdash;to the jolly novelist
when he was in need of them, for Lawrence tells us
that he sent Fielding a present of 200 guineas, in
admiration of his genius, before they were personally
acquainted; and on Fielding's death Allen took
charge of his family, provided for their education,
and left £100 a year between them.</p>

<p>Pope,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> whose acquaintance with Allen dated from
1736, brought Warburton. Sitting one day at dinner,
at Prior Park, the poet had a letter handed to him,
which he read apparently with some disappointment
on finding that he should probably miss an opportunity
of meeting his friend. Allen, however, on hearing the
cause of Pope's trouble, with characteristic native
politeness begged him to ask Warburton to the house&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
pleasant task which Pope, who used to say that his
host's friendship was 'one of the chief satisfactions
of his life,'performed in the following letter, which I
insert as giving us a peep at the sort of life led in
those days by Allen and his friends, and also as
affording us a glimpse of the house itself:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'My third motive of now troubling you is my own
proper interest and pleasure. I am here in more
leisure than I can possibly enjoy, even in my own
house, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vacare Literis</i>. It is at this place that your
exhortations may be most effectual to make me
resume the studies I had almost laid aside by perpetual
avocations and dissipations. If it were practicable
for you to pass a month or six weeks from
home, it is here I could wish to be with you; and if
you would attend to the continuation of your own
noble work, or unbend to the idle amusement of
commenting upon a poet, who has no other merit
than that of aiming, by his moral strokes, to merit
some regard from such men as advance truth and
virtue in a more effectual way; in either case this
place and this house would be an inviolable asylum
to you from all you would desire to avoid in so public
a scene as Bath. The worthy man who is the master
of it invites you in the strongest terms, and is one
who would treat you with love and veneration, rather
than with what the world calls civility and regard.
He is sincerer and plainer than almost any man now
in this world, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">antiquis moribus</i>. If the waters of the
Bath may be serviceable to your complaints (as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
believe from what you have told me of them), no
opportunity can ever be better. It is just the best
season. We are told the Bishop of Salisbury (Dr.
Sherlock) is expected here daily, who, I know, is
your friend&mdash;at least, though a bishop, is too much
a man of learning to be your enemy. You see, I
omit nothing to add weight in the balance, in which,
however, I will not think <em>myself</em> light, since I have
known your partiality. You will want no servant
here. Your room will be next to mine, and one man
will serve us. Here is a library, and a gallery ninety
feet long to walk in, and a coach whenever you
would take the air with me. Mr. Allen tells me you
might, on horseback, be here in three days. It is
less than 100 miles from Newark, the road through
Leicester, Stowe-in-the-Wolds, Gloucestershire, and
Cirencester, by Lord Bathurst's. I could engage
to carry you to London from hence, and I would
accommodate my time and journey to your conveniency.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The long gallery referred to above was a very
favourite part of the house with Pope, and here he
used to walk up and down in 'a morning dishabille
consisting of a dark grey waistcoat, a green dressing-gown,
and a blue cap,' as he is represented in the
well-known portrait by Hoare.</p>

<p>A pleasant glance at the friendly terms on which
the trio used to live at Prior Park is afforded to us in
Kilvert's 'Selections from Warburton,' which has for
its frontispiece a lithograph from a picture, formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
at Prior Park, of Pope, Allen, and Warburton
('Wit, Worth, and Wisdom'), in a room together.
Allen is seated in the centre of the group; on his
left is Warburton, bringing into the room a ponderous
folio; and, seated at a table at the opposite side of
the picture, the little poet is seen writing; in the
background, through a window, is disclosed a view of
Bath. It is difficult to understand how Pope, after all
this friendly intimacy, could quarrel with Allen, and
call Warburton 'a sneaking parson.'</p>

<p>Hurd also, successively Bishop of Lichfield and
Coventry, and of Worcester, was a frequent visitor
to Prior Park, and after his friendly host's decease
commemorated his worth by an inscription (now
effaced) on a look-out tower in the park:</p>

<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Memoriæ optimi viri, <span class="smcap">Radulphi Allen</span>, positum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Qui virtutem veram simplicemque colis, venerare hoc saxum.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I do not know whether General Wade was ever
entertained here by Allen; but that the latter did not
forget his early patron he showed by erecting the
General's statue in front of the house. Pitt, who sat
for Bath, certainly came here, and each held the
other in the highest regard. Allen left him £1,000
by his will, as 'the best of friends as well as the most
upright and ablest of Ministers that has adorned our
country.' Nor did 'the heaven-born Minister' fail
to appreciate the Cornishman's virtues, or to extend
to others, for his sake, friendly offices; for to Pitt,
Warburton (who had married Allen's favourite niece,
Gertrude Tucker, a lady to whom he left Prior Park
for life) was indebted for his bishopric. At one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
time, indeed, there was a slight coolness between
Pitt and Allen, owing to the introduction of the word
'adequate' into an address from the men of Bath in
a memorial to the King, referring to the Peace of
1763. Pitt thought the Peace extremely '<em>in</em>adequate,'
and so much resented the use of the word that he
refused to join his colleague, Sir John Seabright, in
presenting the memorial; and whilst he vowed he
would never again stand for Bath, Allen from that
time avowed his intention of withdrawing from all
public affairs. In the correspondence which ensued,
Ralph Allen magnanimously took upon himself the
entire responsibility for the insertion of the obnoxious
word; and he adds in a letter to Pitt, which will be
found in the <cite>Royal Magazine</cite> for 1763, that the communication
of Pitt's unalterable decision in the matter
to the Corporation of Bath was 'the most painful
commission he ever received.' That this event,
however, did not affect the high regard in which
the two held each other is evinced, on the one
hand, by the manner in which (as we have seen)
Allen expressed himself regarding Pitt, in his will; and
on the other by a letter which Pitt wrote during the
unfortunate controversy, in which he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'I cannot conclude my letter without expressing
my sensible concern at Mr. Allen's uneasiness. No
incident can make the least change in the honour
and love I bear him, or in the justice my heart does
to his humane and benevolent virtues.'</p></div>

<p>And Pitt wrote in a similar strain to Mrs. Allen<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
on her husband's death, saying, 'I fear not all the
example of his virtues will have power to raise up to
the world his like again.'</p>

<p>That Pitt had good reason thus to write of his
deceased friend is abundantly clear from the following
letter, preserved amongst the Egerton MSS. in
the British Museum:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p class="right small">'St. James's Square, Dec. 16, 1760. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>'<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The very affecting token of esteem and affection
which you put into my hands last night at parting,

neither express nor conceal. If the approbation of

with such an endearing act of kindness from the best of
men? True Gratitude is ever the justest of Sentiments,
and Pride too, which I indulge on this occasion,
may, I trust, not be disclaim'd by Virtue. May
the gracious Heaven long continue to <em>lend</em> you to

<p class="right pyy">'<span class="smcap">W. Pitt</span>.' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Very different from this noble passage in the lives
of these two illustrious men was that which, for a
while at least, disturbed the friendly feelings of Allen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
towards Pope. The equivocal relations which existed
between the poet and Martha Blount are well known;&mdash;'the
fiend, a woman fiend, God help me! with
whom I have spent three or four hours a day these
fifteen years.' She seems, nevertheless, to have been
tolerated at Allen's house at Bathampton hard by;
but when she demanded the use of Mr. Allen's
chariot to attend a Roman Catholic Chapel at Bath,
Allen being a staunch Protestant and Hanoverian,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
the line was drawn, and a coolness, if not a quarrel,
ensued. Pope used to deny the whole story. At
any rate the breach was patched up, and intimacy
between him and Allen was resumed; but the
waspish little man never, in my opinion, either
forgot or forgave what happened, and to this the
following extract from his will,&mdash;a will, as Johnson
said, 'polluted with female resentment,'&mdash;suave
though the passage reads at first, I think bears
witness:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'I give and advise my library of printed books to
Ralph Allen, of Widcombe, Esq., and to the
Reverend Mr. William Warburton, or to the survivor
of them (when those belonging to Lord Bolingbroke
are taken out, and when Mrs. Martha Blount has
chosen threescore out of the number). I also give
and bequeath to the said Mr. Warburton the property
of all such of my works already printed, as he
hath written, or shall write, commentaries or notes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
upon, and which I have not otherwise disposed of,
or alienated; and all the profits which shall arise
after my death from such editions as he shall publish
without future alterations.</p>

<p>'Item.&mdash;In case Ralph Allen, Esq., abovesaid,
shall survive me, I order my executors to pay him
the sum of one hundred and fifty pounds, being, to
the best of my calculation, the account of what I
have received from him; <em>partly for my own, and partly
for charitable uses</em>. If he refuses to take this himself,
I desire him to employ it in a way, I am persuaded,
he will not dislike, to the benefit of the Bath
Hospital.'&mdash;Extract from the Will of Pope (p. clxi.,
Pope's Works, vol. i., Bell and Daldy's Aldine
edition).</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>When the passage was read to Ralph Allen, he, of
course, ordered that the money should be handed over
to the hospital (an institution in which it may be
observed he always took a deep interest, providing
the stone, and giving £1,000 besides: a ward is
named after him, where his portrait<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> is preserved,
and also a bust by William Hoare of Bath, dated
1757); but he drily added, in allusion to the extent
of the obligations which Pope had received from
him, 'He forgot to add the other 0 to the £150,'&mdash;a
quiet, but perhaps as keen a stab as Pope himself
had ever dealt with his own malevolent stiletto. And
Allen was a man who could afford to say so much,
for he used to spend about £1,000 a year in private
charities alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Many of the letters of Pope to be found among the
Egerton MSS. have endorsements by Allen in his own
handwriting. On one of them is written 'The last;'
and Pope concludes it&mdash;evidently, from the change
in the handwriting, in great pain&mdash;thus: 'I must
just set my hand to my heart.' It is dated 'Chelsea
College, 7th May, 1741.' The letters also comprise
some correspondence from Gertrude Warburton (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">née</i>
Tucker), Allen's favourite niece; from Warburton
himself; and from many other distinguished persons.</p>

<p>Besides Prior Park, Allen had a house in London;
and another at Weymouth&mdash;a place where he
often resided for three months annually, and whose
decaying fortunes he took a chief share in reviving,
about the year 1763<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>&mdash;and I rather think he
had another house at Maidenhead, near the west
end of the bridge, to which house he added a
room with a bow-window, and another room over
it.</p>

<p>He certainly had a pleasant little retreat at Bathampton;
for in a characteristic letter from Pope to
Arbuthnot (the roughly humorous physician, strong
Tory, and High Churchman), dated 23rd July, 1793,
Pope explains how Allen would not let the two
friends stay at his villa at Bathampton, but insisted
upon having them both up at Prior Park; because,
Pope observes, 'I suspect that he has an apprehension
in his head that if he lends that house to us, others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
hereabouts may try to borrow it, which would be disagreeable
to him, he making it a kind of villa to
change to, and pass now and then a day at it, in
private.'</p>

<p>But Prior Park was Ralph Allen's historic abode;
and one object which he had in view in building it
was to demonstrate the excellent quality of the stone<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
in his Combe Down Quarries. The whole building,
which is in the Corinthian style, with its wings and
arcades and fine hexastyle portico has a frontage of
1,250 feet; the house itself being 150 feet. We have
seen from Pope's letter to Warburton what spacious
corridors it contained, admirably adapted for literary
disquisitions on a wet day. The mansion also comprised
its chapel, in which was kept the Bible given to
Pope by Atterbury when the Bishop went into exile.
Everything was built in the most solid style. Even
the pigeon-houses were of stone throughout; and,
strange as it may seem, roofs were composed
of the same material. The house was commenced
in 1736 and finished in 1743; nor did Allen forget to
add to the charms of the demesne by judiciously
arranged plantations.</p>

<p>Building, indeed, seems to have been, naturally
enough with such magnificent quarries at his disposal,
a favourite occupation of Allen's. He even crowned
the hill which looks down upon the city of Bath from
the south-east with a large and somewhat picturesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
structure,&mdash;a mere shell, now known as 'Sham
Castle;' but which, especially when lit up by the
setting sun, is a not unwelcome addition to the
panoramic view of the hills as seen from the east end
of Pulteney Street. A short time ago, whilst walking
along this street, I asked a man, lounging there, who
built the castle on the hill? and (alas! such is fame!)
he told me that it was 'a Mr. Nash, a gentleman
that had done a power of good to the city.' And
here it may conveniently be observed that Beau Nash,
to whom Dr. Oliver says Ralph Allen was 'very
generous' (as he was, indeed, to everyone who had the
slightest claim upon his notice), generally superintended
the amusements <em>within</em> the walls of Prior
Park. On the occasion of one of these entertainments&mdash;a
masked ball&mdash;the solemn Warburton, who
thought it beneath the dignity of his cloth to wear a
mask, was nevertheless dressed up in a military
uniform by his sprightly wife, and was introduced to
the company as 'Brigadier-General Moses!' in allusion,
I suppose, to Warburton's authorship of the
'Divine Legation.'</p>

<p>The following local tradition respecting the building
of Prior Park was communicated to Mr. Kilvert
by the late Mr. H. V. Lansdown, of Bath, the well-known
artist, a gentleman who had accumulated a
large collection of reminiscences of Bath, and its
Worthies of the olden time:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'When Mr. Allen had determined to build the
present mansion at Prior Park, he sent for John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Wood, the architect,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> who waited upon him at the
old post-office in Liliput Alley, where Allen then
resided.</p>

<p>'"I want you," said Allen, "to build me a country
house on the Prior's estate at Widcombe."</p>

<p>'Allen then described the sort of place he wished
erected; but when he entered into the details, and
talked about a private chapel, with a tribune for the
family; a portico of gigantic dimensions; a grand
entrance-hall, and wings of offices for coach-houses,
stables, etc., the astonished architect began to think
the postmaster had taken leave of his senses.</p>

<p>'"Have you, sir, sat down and counted the cost
of building such a place?"</p>

<p>'"I have," replied Allen; "and for some time
past have been laying by money for the purpose."</p>

<p>'"But," said Wood, "the place you are talking
about would be a palace, and not a house; you have
not the least idea of the money 'twould take to complete
it."</p>

<p>'"Well," rejoined Allen, "come this way."</p>

<p>'He then took Wood into the next room, and,
opening a closet-door, showed him a strong box.</p>

<p>'"That box is full of guineas!"</p>

<p>'The architect shook his head. Allen opened
another closet, and pointed to a second and a third.
Wood still hesitated.</p>

<p>'"Well," said Allen, "come into this room."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
'A fourth and fifth are discovered. The architect
now began to open his eyes with wonder.</p>

<p>'"If we have not money enough&mdash;here, come into
this bedroom."</p>

<p>'A sixth, a seventh, and lo! an eighth appears.
John Wood might well have exclaimed:</p>

<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i24">'"I'll see no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For perhaps, like Banquo's ghosts, you'll show a score."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'Chuckling in his turn at the astonishment of the
architect, Allen now inquired if the house <em>could</em> be
built.</p>

<p>'"I'll begin the plans immediately," replied
Wood. "I see there is money enough to erect
even a palace, and I'll build you a palace that shall
be the admiration of all beholders."'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>But we must hasten to a close; a close to which
the next allusion to the building propensities of the
generous subject of this memoir naturally leads us.
In 1754, Ralph Allen rebuilt the south aisle of
Bathampton Church, and 'beautified the whole
structure.' Appropriately enough, in that aisle has
been placed an oval mural tablet, of white and Sienna
marble, to his memory; and his son Philip, who
became Comptroller of the 'Bye-letter' department
in the London Post Office, was, I believe, actually
buried there.</p>

<p>But the remains of Ralph Allen were interred in
the neighbouring quiet and lovely little churchyard at
Claverton. He was on his way to London, but feeling
ill, probably from asthma, a complaint which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
often troubled him, halted at Maidenhead, and was
induced to return thence to Bath, where he expired
at a good old age, which the pyramidal monument
erected at Claverton to his memory thus records:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Beneath this monument lieth entombed the body
of Ralph Allen, Esq., of Prior Park, who departed
this life the 29th day of June, 1764, in the 71st year
of his age; in full hopes of everlasting happiness
in another state, through the infinite merit and
mediation of our blessed Redeemer, Jesus Christ.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Derrick has thus described Allen's personal appearance
shortly before his death: 'He is a very grave,
well-looking man, plain in his dress, resembling that
of a Quaker, and courteous in his behaviour. I
suppose he cannot be much under seventy. His
wife is low, with grey hair, and of a very pleasing
address.' Kilvert says that he was rather above the
middle size, and stoutly built; and that he was not
altogether averse to a little state, as he often used to
drive into Bath in a coach-and-four. His handwriting
was very curious; he evidently wrote quickly
and fluently, but it is so overloaded with curls and
flourishes as to be sometimes scarcely legible.</p>

<p>The lack of all show about his garb seems to have
somewhat annoyed Philip Thicknesse, the well-known
author of one of the Bath Guides; for he
speaks of Allen's 'plain linen shirt-sleeves, with only
a chitterling up the slit.' Ralph Allen's claims to a
niche in our Cornish Valhalla do not, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
depend upon costume, but upon his talents and his
philanthropy.</p>

<p>Writing to Dr. Doddridge on 14th February,
1742-43, Warburton thus refers to his genial host:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'I got home a little before Christmas, after a
charming philosophical retirement in a palace with
Mr. Pope and Mr. Allen for two or three months.
The gentleman I last mentioned is, I verily believe,
the greatest private character in any age of the
world. You see his munificence to the Bath Hospital.
This is but a small part of his charities, and
charity but a small part of his virtues. I have
studied his character even maliciously, to find where
his weakness lies, but have studied in vain. When I
know it, the world shall know it too, for the consolation
of the envious; especially as I suspect it will
prove to be only a partiality he has entertained for
me. In a word, I firmly believe him to have been
sent by Providence into the world to teach men what
blessings they might expect from heaven, would they
study to deserve them.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>In Bishop Hurd's 'Life of Warburton,' the following
passage occurs, and upon this 'the Man of
Bath's' fame might securely rest:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Mr. Allen was of that generous composition, that
his mind enlarged with his fortune; and the wealth
he so honourably acquired he spent in a splendid
hospitality and the most extensive charities. His
house, in so public a scene as that of Bath, was open
to all men of rank and worth, and especially to men
of distinguished parts and learning, whom he honoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and encouraged, and whose respective merits he was
enabled to appreciate by a natural discernment and
superior good sense rather than by any acquired use
and knowledge of letters. His domestic virtues
were beyond all praise; and with these qualities he
drew to himself an universal respect.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>It would be easy, if necessary, to multiply passages
of this sort, but one more shall suffice,
as illustrating the almost universal recognition of
what Mr. Leslie Stephen has well termed Allen's
'princely benevolence and sterling worth.' Mrs.
Delany (iii. 608), writing from Bath, 2nd November,
1760, mentions that the house on the South
Parade where she was then lodging had been
bought by Ralph Allen, furniture and all, in order
that he might settle it on Mrs. Davis, a poor clergyman's
widow. 'How well does <em>that man</em>,' she adds,
'deserve the prosperous fortune he has met with!'
And behind all this there doubtless remained, in the
case of our modest hero:</p>

<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">'That best portion of a good man's life,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">His little, <em>nameless</em>, <em>unremembered</em> acts<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of kindness and of love.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A notice of this remarkable man would be incomplete
without some reference to two of his connexions,
whose names are still honoured and remembered in
the West country: Thomas Daniell, who married
Ralph Allen's niece, Elizabeth Elliott; and Ralph
Allen Daniell, Thomas's son. Of the last-named, it
may be shortly stated that he inherited a full share
of his grand-uncle's and namesake's good qualities;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
was a prosperous merchant; and that he became, in
1800, the possessor of Trelissick estate, and the
builder of the exquisitely situated mansion of that
name, which overlooks the placid waters of Falmouth
Haven. Here Davies Gilbert, P.R.S., resided; and
it is now the country seat of his son's widow, the
Honourable Mrs. Gilbert.</p>

<p>The Thomas Daniell mentioned above appears to
have started in life as a clerk to Mr. Lemon, who
then lived at the Quay, Truro, in the house now
known as the Britannia Inn. Here, too, once lived
Dr. Wolcot, better known as 'Peter Pindar;' and, in
the middle of the present century, the writer's father,
John Tabois Tregellas, well-known throughout the
county as a writer on the Cornish dialect. Mr.
Daniell succeeded to Mr. Lemon's business as a
merchant, and to his residence. He was also
associated with the well-known old Cornish family
of Michell,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> in the Calenick Smelting Works, near
Truro, which are still in active operation. Thomas
Daniell was a great and successful adventurer in
mines, and was at one time M.P. for Looe. He left
his mark upon the little Cornish metropolis by
building, as already mentioned, in Prince's Street,
the handsomest mansion which the city contains,
the front of which is an excellent specimen of the
famous Bath stone.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p class="drop-capi2"><span class="smcap">There</span>
 were three Cornishmen in succession,
more or less known, who bore
the above name. The grandfather, of
whom little more is now ascertainable
than that he was Registrar of the Archdeacon
of Cornwall's Court (then held at St. Neot's),<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> that
his wife's name was Mary Smith, and that he died
in 1692; his son, the subject of this notice; and his
grandson, who, like the second John Anstis, was also
Garter King of Arms, and who died a bachelor at
a comparatively early age. In Montagu Burrows'
'Worthies of All Souls,' it is stated that the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Anstis was of founder's kin; yet he failed to secure his
election, notwithstanding a lawsuit instituted for that
purpose.</p>

<p>Of the first and the third John Anstis little need
be added, but the second merits a longer notice; for
'in him,' it is said, 'were joined the learning of Camden
and the industry, without the inaccuracy, of Dugdale.'
Born at Luna, on 28th September, 1669, in the
parish of St. Neot's, near Liskeard, about one mile
south-west of its interesting church, he became a
member of Exeter College, Oxford, in 1685; and,
having entered at the Middle Temple in 1688, and
been appointed Deputy-General to the Auditors of
the Imprest in 1703, and a Principal Commissioner
of Prizes in 1704, was elected, when about thirty years
of age, a member of the first Parliament of Queen
Anne, for St. Germans, and was one of those who
opposed the Occasional Conformity Bill; then, in
1711, member for St. Mawes; and finally member
for Launceston in the first Parliament of George I.
(1714-22). His first printed work on Heraldry seems
to have been his (privately printed) 'Curia Militaris,'
or 'Treatise of the Court of Chivalry,' which was
published in 1702, and dedicated to Sir Jonathan
Trelawny, the well-known non-juring Bishop of
Exeter. In 1718 John Anstis was created Garter
King of Arms, and six years afterwards he published
his 'Annotated Register of the Most Noble Order of
the Garter:' the copy which belonged to Dean
Milles, who was born at Duloe, of which parish he
was rector for forty-two years, is in the London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Library.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Able and indefatigable both in and out of
office, a voluminous correspondence with Sidney
Godolphin, Sir Hans Sloane, Thomas Hearne the
antiquary, and other distinguished men of the period,
as well as similar treatises to the foregoing, followed
from his pen, including his 'Aspilogia,' or 'A Discourse
on Seals in England,' and fragments of a
'History of Cornwall,' etc., as to which copious
information is afforded in the 'Bibliotheca Cornubiensis.'</p>

<p>Many of his MSS. are preserved in the Additional,
Lansdowne, Harleian, Sloane, Birch, and
Hargrave Collections at the British Museum; his
proposals for publishing a history of the Order of the
Garter are preserved in the Bodleian, whilst others of
his numerous writings are in the libraries of All Souls'
and Worcester Colleges, Oxford. He also wrote a
MS. 'History of Launceston,' which, as well as
others of his works, is now believed to be lost; and
it may be added that he was intimately connected
with the production of Rymer's 'Fœdera.'</p>

<p>Perhaps the most stirring event of his life was his
imprisonment on the suspicion of a design to restore
the Stuart dynasty, the story of which is as follows.
He was a member of the High Church party, and, as
such, opposed what was called the Whig interest,
voting, as mentioned above, against the Occasional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Conformity Bill; but, on the information of one Colonel
Paul, he, as well as five or six other members of Parliament,
fell under the suspicion of the Government,
and Anstis was actually in prison at the very time
that the office of Garter (which had been promised to
him by Queen Anne) fell vacant. It was with the
utmost difficulty that he cleared himself of these
suspicions, and not until three years afterwards did
he obtain the appointment, which had meanwhile
been held by Sir John Vanbrugh, 'Clarenceux.' One
of his fellow-suspects, Edward Harvey, Esq., stabbed
himself with his garden pruning-knife, on a certain
paper in his own handwriting being shown to him.
John Anstis is described in the scarce tract which
narrates this affair as being 'Hereditary High
Steward of the Tinners of Cornwall,' and it is probable
that in this capacity he may have been suspected
of being concerned in some supposed
insurrection in the county. But imprisonment in
those days for like causes was sometimes, if the
truth were told, somewhat of the nature of a
political manœuvre.</p>

<p>John Anstis, F.S.A., the subject of this notice,
died at his seat at Mortlake, Surrey, on 4th March,
1744, at a good old age, and his remains were laid in
the family vault at Duloe, near Looe, some three
weeks afterwards. His son at once succeeded (by a
reversionary patent) to his father's post in the
Heralds' College; and his remains followed his
father's to their last resting-place in the same
quiet churchyard on the 30th December, 1754.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
There is a portrait of the more celebrated Herald
in the picture gallery at Oxford, and another at the
College of Arms; and an engraved likeness is prefixed
to the Rev. Mark Noble's history of that institution.
There is another engraved portrait of him,
in his tabard, in Nichols' 'Literary Illustrations,'
vol. iv. p. 139. He married Elizabeth, the heiress
of Richard Cudlipp, Esq., of Tavistock, and left
three sons and three daughters. I believe that, as
in the case of many another distinguished Cornishman,
there is no monument to the memory of even
the most celebrated member of the family. Yet, as
a Christian name, the name of Anstis still lingers in
the neighbourhood, and is borne by members of the
family of Bewes, the present representatives through
the female line.</p>

<p class="drop-capi2"><span class="smcap">On</span>
 the north-west coast of Cornwall, famous
for its magnificent cliff scenery and fine
stretches of golden sand, are four lovely
valleys</p>

<p class="center small">'Looking towards the western wave,'<br /></p>

<p class="noindent">lying close together, and each watered by a little
trout-stream; but, as is the case with Cornish landscape
generally, with one exception scantily timbered.
Each of these is more or less directly
connected with the celebrated family of Arundell. I
refer, first, to a valley through which a small stream
murmurs, which rose on the northern slope of
Denzell Downs, and flows near St. Ervan Church,
having for its little tributaries two rivulets which
water the foot of the sloping ground on which still
stands a farm-place, called Trembleath, and entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the sea at Portcothan Bay; secondly, to the Vale of
Lanherne, which extends from St. Columb Major to
Mawgan Porth, and includes two churches, so named;
next, to the valley with a nameless brook, which
flows past Rialton&mdash;formerly the residence of the
haughty Thomas Vivian, one of the latest Priors of
Bodmin, and afterwards a seat of the Godolphins&mdash;then
by the base of a hill crowned by the lofty tower
of St. Columb Minor; and lastly, to the vale of the
Gannel, near whose embouchure are the remains of
the ancient collegiate establishment of Crantock, now
represented by the highly interesting church, which,
though nearly complete, is in a very unsatisfactory
state of repair.</p>

<p>Each of these valleys has its porth (or port),
a circumstance to which they were all probably
indebted for the churches which they still possess;
for in the days of small shipping, these little ports&mdash;smaller
now than they formerly were&mdash;sufficiently
accommodated the tiny craft which brought holy
men from Ireland, or from South Wales, and, indeed,
at that time probably afforded the chief means
of communication with the outer world.</p>

<p>It is the second of these four valleys that we have
chiefly to consider now, closely identified as it is with
the names of the Arundells&mdash;'the great Arundells,' as
they were called (on account, says Camden, of their
vast riches), and as they called themselves, too; for
on one of their tombs in the church of St.
Columb Major was inscribed, 'Magnorum sepulchra
Arundeliorum.' Parts of the vale are beautifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
wooded, and the churches of St. Columb and
Mawgan, which retain many features of interest,
are both identified with the famous family whose
story we are about to consider.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> And here it
should be premised that, besides the Arundells of
Lanherne, Trerice, Tolverne, and Wardour, there
were the Arundells of Menadarva, who afterwards
settled at Trengwainton, near Penzance, descended
from a Camborne stock, founded by a 'natural' son
of an Arundell of Trerice, who intermarried with
Pendarves and St. Aubyn. And again, the Arundells
of Trevithick, in St. Columb Major, were a younger
branch of the Lanherne family. They settled
there <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</i> Edward VI., and became extinct in
1740.</p>

<p>Of the first three branches I propose to treat
under the heads of Lanherne, Trerice, and Tolverne;
and to conclude my observations with a short
reference to one or two minor branches of the
family.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt, although Hals, with his
usual ingenuity (and it might also be said, I fear,
with his usual inaccuracy), has endeavoured to
find a Cornish etymology for the name, that the
name of Arundell is of French origin. At any rate,
such was the belief in the early part of the thirteenth
century; for they bore swallows in their
escutcheon at least as early as the days of Henry II.;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and in the 'Philippeis,' a work composed by Philip
le Breton in 1230, there are the following verses
descriptive of an encounter between an Arundell and
one William de Barr:</p>

<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'Vidit Hirundelâ velocior alite quæ dat<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Hoc Agnomen ei, fert cujus in ægide signum<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Se rapit agminibus mediis clypeoque nitenti<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Quem sibi Guillelmus lævâ prætenderat ulnâ<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Immergit validam præacutæ cuspidis hastam.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right small">(See p. 207, Camden's 'Remains,' 1637.) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /></p>

<p class="noindent">But it is perhaps right to add that Davies Gilbert,
P.R.S., a Cornish gentleman, who settled in Sussex,
thought the name might have been derived from
Arun Dale.</p>

<p>According to Mr. G. Freeth (<cite>R. I. C. Journal</cite>,
September, 1876, pp. 285-93), Trembleth (a name
still retained), in the adjoining parish of St. Ervan,
was the chief seat of the Arundells before their
marriage with the heiress of Lanherne. At any rate,
Trembleth (situated in the northernmost of the four
valleys mentioned above) was a residence of some of
the subsequent members of the family. Hals gives
the following interesting account of the place:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Trembleigh, Trembleth, <em>alias</em> Trembleeth, <em>alias</em>
Tremblot (see Tremblethick, in St. Mabyn), synonymous
terms, signifies the "wolf's town."</p>

<p>'From this place was denominated an ancient
family of gentlemen, surnamed De Trembleth, who,
suitable to their name, gave the wolf for their arms;
whose sole inheritrix, about Henry II.'s time,
was married to John de Arundel, ancestor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Arundels of Lanherne; who, out of respect and
grateful remembrance of the great benefit they had
by this match, ever since gave the wolf for their
crest, the proper arms of Trembleth.</p>

<p>'In this town they had their domestic chapel and
burying-place, now totally gone to decay, since those
Arundels removed from hence to Lanherne. This
manor was anciently held of the manor of Payton,
by the tenure of knight's service. And here John de
Arundel held a knight's fee (Morton, 3rd Henry IV.),
as I am informed.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The assumption of their French origin is further
borne out by the fact that the early Arundells&mdash;especially
one, Roger&mdash;obtained from the Conqueror
considerable grants of land in Dorsetshire and
Staffordshire. I have, however, been unable to
obtain any clear traces of their connexion with
Cornwall earlier than towards the middle of the
thirteenth century, when they presented to the
churches of St. Columb Major and of Mawgan.
Again, a Sir Ralph Arundell was Sheriff of Cornwall
in 1260; and, indeed, Hals observes that the Arundells
filled the same office twenty times, of which there
was no like instance in England. Some member of
the family was generally knighted at the accession
of a new sovereign to the throne, and one of the
early Arundells was Marshal of England.</p>

<p>Amongst the monuments in the church of St.
Columb Major is one to a John Arundell, once
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">'senescallus Dñi Regis et verus patronus hujus
ecclesiæ, qui hanc capellam fieri fecit.'</span> He died in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the year 1400, and stained glass in the windows also
commemorated at this date the family. There are
also Arundell brasses at Antony East, Mawgan, and
Stratton, and a monument at Newlyn East.</p>

<p>They held Lanherne of the Bishop of Exeter by
military service, as appears from folio 102 of Bishop
Stapledon's Register: it is therein called 'La
Herne,' but it was also known formerly as Lanhadron.</p>

<p>Amongst other indications of their early settlement
in the county, and of their importance from the very
first, it may be mentioned that:</p>

<p class="negidt4">
'Rad., son of Oliver de Arundell, of Lanherne,
had £20 a year or more, in land, in 1297;
and so had John Arundell, of Efford.</p>

<p class="negidt4">
'Rad. D'Arundle held a "parv. feo." in Trekinnen.</p>

<p class="negidt4">
'Johannes D'Arundle held military feus in
Treawset and in Trenbeith, in 3rd Hen. IV.
(1402). Also a "parv. feod." in Trekinnen.'</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>From the Records preserved at Exeter, the following
further information, which bears upon the early
connexion of the Arundells with the far West, has
been gathered; and it is scarcely to be doubted that
still earlier traces of their settlement in Cornwall
might at one time have been forthcoming:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Willus de Arundell, canonicus obiit vi. Kal.
Maii, MCCXLVI.'</p></div>

<p class="right">(<cite>Exeter Cathedral Martyrologium.</cite>) &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /></p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>But most of their monumental remains which
still exist, are of later date, and are met with at
various places in Cornwall, chiefly in the eastern
parishes.</p>

<p>A Roger Arundell lived opposite the portico of St.
Stephen's Church, in the High Street, Exeter, about
the middle of the thirteenth century, and a Ralph
Arundell, who was rector of St. Columb Major,
resigned his benefice in 1353, whereupon the bishop
(Grandison) granted him a pension of £20 a year,
in consideration of his near relationship to Sir James
Arundell, patron of the benefice.</p>

<p>Amongst the documents preserved in Bishop
Lacy's Register is the will of Sir John Arundell,
dated 18th April, 1433; he was probably that Sir
John who is said to have had (temp. Ric. II.) no
less than fifty-two complete suits of cloth of gold.
This will refers to so much that is of interest, that I
have been tempted to set down a few passages
from it:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir John leaves his soul to Almighty God, the
Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the saints; and his
body to be buried in the new chapel near the chancel
of the church of St. Columb Major. He gives £20
towards the bells of that church, 60 shillings towards
the restoration of St. Erme Church, and 20 shillings
to the rector of the same. A like sum for the
restoration of the church of Maugan de Lanherne,
and 20 shillings for the maintenance of divers lights
therein, and £10 for the bell-tower, provided the
requisite work is done within the following six years.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
<p>The rectors of St. Ewe, St. Mawgan juxta Carminow,
and St. Wynwole (Gunwalloe) also receive bequests.
He gives 13s. 4d. to the light of St. Michael's in the
Mount,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and the same sum towards the construction
of the chancel there. St. Perran Zabuloe also
comes in for his bounty, and £13 are to be spent in
3,000 masses, to be celebrated for the benefit of his
soul as quickly as possible after his death. To his
blood-relation, Isabelle Bevylle, he leaves 4 marks;
to John Tresithny, 10; to John Michell, 5;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and to
others named, similar sums. But perhaps the most
singular bequest of all is the following, viz., <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">'Item,
lego ad usum parochie S' ci Pyerani in Zabulo ad
claudendum capud S. Pierani honorificè et meliori
modo quo sciunt xls.'</span><a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> One is curious to know why
the testator took such special interest in this singular
relic. Certainly the Arundells were interested in the
parish, and, as we shall presently see, one of them
married the heiress of its chief manor. He finally
leaves sundry vessels of precious metal to his son,
'Renfrido,' etc., and names as his executors, Bishop
Lacy, his sons, Thomas (miles) and Renfr&mdash;, Otho
Tregoney, and others.</p>

<p>It would be a fruitless task to endeavour to give
details of the genealogy of the earlier Arundells, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>it is enveloped in considerable uncertainty; and even
so patient and skilled an investigator as Colonel
J. L. Vivian, in his 'Annotated Heralds' Visitations
of Cornwall,' has discovered such serious discrepancies
in the various statements concerning it, that
he gives up some portions of it in despair. We have
seen that Roger was the Christian name of the
Arundell at the time of the Conquest; in 1216, his
grandson, William, forfeited his lands by rebellion (a
tendency to which offence was, as we shall see,
rather characteristic of the family), but the estates
were restored to the rebellious William's nephew,
Humphry. By the latter's marriage with Joan de
Umfraville, he had a son, Sir Renfry de Arundell of
Treffry, and by Renfry's marriage with Alice de
Lanherne, in the time of Henry III., the name of
Arundell became for many a long year associated
with that of Lanherne. One of their sons, Sir
Ralph, was, as we have seen, Sheriff of Cornwall in
the same reign (1260), and from his marriage with a
lady who bore the euphonious name of Eva de Rupe,
or de la Roche, of Tremodret,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> in Duloe parish, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
main stem of the family seems to have shot forth its
boughs and branches. Their younger son, Ralph,
was that rector of St. Columb Major, who, as we
have seen, resigned his living in 1353, or, according
to some other authorities, in 1309. But their eldest
son, Sir John of Trembleth, in the time of Edward I.,
married Joan le Soor, of Tolverne, and thus appears
to have originated the connection which so long subsisted
between the two branches of the family. Their
children, Margaret and Sir John, married, the former
with a Beville, and the latter with a Carminow; and
now, for the first time, the name of Trerice also appears
in the family tree, for this Sir John is said to
have had a cousin, Ralph Arundell of that place. I
cannot trace his descent, and can only suggest that
he <em>may</em> have been a brother instead of a cousin. If
I have correctly interpreted the pedigree, the last-named
Sir John was a man of mark, and of him we
have the following accounts:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'In the year 1379, an expedition was fitted out by
King Richard II., in the second year of his reign, in
aid of the Duke of Bretagne, under the command of
"Dominus Johannes Arundell," as old Thomas
Walsingham, a learned monk of St. Albans, calls
him.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> On their way, after repulsing the French fleet
off the coast of Cornwall, and whilst waiting for a
favourable wind to cross the Channel, the commander
of the expedition besought the hospitality of
a certain convent of nuns (according to one account,
at Netley), the lady superintendent of which very
properly refused it to so rough and ready a band of
military as composed Arundell's following. She
besought most earnestly, "prostrata," and "conjunctis
manibus," that he would find quarters for his men
elsewhere, but all in vain. Scenes of a most disgraceful
and violent character ensued, as might have
been expected; and, not content with doing foul
dishonour to the nuns, the soldiery were permitted to
spoil the neighbourhood. They even went so far as
to carry off from the convent the sacred vessels of its
church, and several of the sisterhood as well ("vi vel
sponte"), whereupon they were most righteously excommunicated
by the priest. A violent tempest pursued
them for their misdoings, a diabolical spectre
appearing in Arundell's ship, threatening the dire
disasters which followed. The unhappy women were
flung overboard to lighten the ships, which at length
made the coast of Ireland, upon which event Arundell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
made a speech concluding thus, according to the
chronicler:</p>

<p lang="la" xml:lang="la">'"Minus grave est hoc quam in mare totiens ante
mortem mori, et tandem mortem dedecorosam evadere
nullo modo posse. Aut si inimici sunt qui in
hac terra sunt, citius eligo per manus hostiles interfici
(forsitan cadaveri sepulturam indulgebunt) quam
more pecoris marinis mergi fluctibus, et fieri pelagi
monstris cibus."'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>But the swashbuckler was doomed not to escape
as he had hoped, though finally he was to receive the
sort of burial which he so evidently desired. His
ship was driven on the rocks, and her ship-master
and Sir John Arundell of Treleigh were drowned, together
with his esquires and other men of high birth.
Many were rescued by the Irish, but twenty-five
ships in all were lost, and large numbers of their
crews. Three days afterwards many of the bodies
were recovered, amongst them those of Arundell,
and were buried in a certain abbey in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>As Froissart's account differs from the foregoing
in some particulars, I have appended a translation of
it for the convenience of those who may desire to
compare the two: it will be noticed that Froissart
entirely omits the story of the desecration of the
convent.</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'The time had now arrived for sending off the
promised succour to the Duke of Brittany. Sir John
Arundel was appointed to command the expedition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and there accompanied him Sir Hugh Calverley, Sir
Thomas Banaster, Sir Thomas Trivet, Sir Walter
Pole, Sir John Bourchier, and the Lords Ferrers
and Basset. These knights, with their forces, assembled
at Southampton,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> whence they set sail. The
first day they were at sea the weather was favourable,
but towards evening the wind veered about and
became quite the contrary; so strong and tempestuous
was it, that it drove them on the coast of
Cornwall that night, and as they were afraid to cast
anchor, they were forced the next day into the Irish
Sea; here three of their ships sank, on board of
which were Sir John Arundel, Sir Thomas Banaster,
and Sir Hugh Calverley; the two former, with
upwards of eighty men, perished, but Sir Hugh
fortunately clung to the mast of his vessel and was
blown ashore. The rest of the ships, when the storm
had abated, returned as well as they could to Southampton.
Through this misfortune the expedition
was put an end to, and the Duke of Brittany, though
sadly oppressed by the French, received all that
season no assistance from the English.'&mdash;(<cite>Froissart's
Chronicles</cite>, p. 154.)</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The unlucky knight's grandson was that Sir John
Arundell of Lanherne, who was made a Knight of
the Bath at the coronation of King Henry IV. in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
1399, and who married a lady, who, if she were as
lovely as her lovely name&mdash;Annora or Eleanora
Lambourne, of Perranzabuloe&mdash;must indeed have
been 'beautiful exceedingly.' But, indeed, the
Arundells seem to have been fond of sweet-sounding
Christian names for their womankind. Such names
as Sibilla and Emmota occur very early in the
family-tree. This Sir John must have been a personage
of some valour and consideration; for we
find that he was retained by an indenture of King
Henry V. to serve at sea with 3 knights, 364
men-at-arms, and 776 archers, in certain vessels
which were specified. He was four times Sheriff of
Cornwall, and was member for the county in 1422-23,
together with another John Arundell, apparently.</p>

<p>The next Arundells who claim our attention will
require a little more space to be devoted to the consideration
of their exploits. They were grandsons
of the last-named Sir John; and one of them, also a
Sir John, became Admiral and Sheriff of Cornwall,
and a General for King Henry VI., in France; the
other, his cousin, also named John, became Bishop
of Exeter. To the former of these two, as the senior,
let us first turn.</p>

<p>He was born, or at least baptized, in 1421; and,
his father dying some two years afterwards, he
became a ward of the King, and at length (in the
29th year of the reign of Henry VI.) was the
largest free tenant in Cornwall, his estates being of
the value of £2,000 per annum.</p>

<p>John, the Bishop, was the son of Sir Rainfred (or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Reinfry) Arundell, knight (by Joan Coleshull, his
wife, sister and heir of Sir John Coleshull of Tremodret,
knight), who was the third son of Sir John
Arundel of Lanherne (and not, observes Tonkin,
'Talvern, as Anthony Wood saith'). He is said to
have been educated in the neighbouring College of
Augustine Monks at St. Columb, to which one of his
ancestors is alleged to have been a munificent benefactor,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
as he also was to the church at that place,
building a chapel thereto for himself and family, at
the east end of the south aisle; and here he was
buried in the year 1400.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Educated at Exeter College,
Oxford, he became successively a Canon of Windsor,
Prebendary of York and Salisbury, Dean of Exeter,
and Chancellor of Hereford, and having been consecrated
Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, Nov.
6, 1496, was for his piety and learning translated,
by Henry VII., to Exeter, June 29, 1502. He
died, March 15, 1503, at the house belonging to
the Bishop of Exeter (Exeter House), in the parish
of St. Clement's Danes, London, in which church
he was buried on the south side of the high
altar. His will is preserved at Somerset House.
Weever gives a copy of a 'maimed' inscription on
his tomb. To his Register is prefixed a 'Prologus,'
written by his secretary. It recites his noble descent,
his sound doctrine, and his great virtues, his constant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>attendance at divine service, and his bountiful
hospitality. By his will he left £20 towards the
finishing of St. Mary's Church, Oxford. His portrait
is at Wardour Castle.</p>

<p>Hals, in his account of St. Columb Major, writes
thus of the Bishop (but see note, p. 51):</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Contiguous with this churchyard was formerly
extant a college of Black Monks or Canons Augustine,
consisting of three fellows, for instructing
youth in the liberal arts and sciences; which college,
when or by whom erected and endowed, I know not.
However, I take it to be one of those three colleges
in this province, named in Speed and Dugdale's
Monasticon, whose revenues they do not express (nor
the place where they were extant), but tell us that they
were dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Lady
of Angels, and were black monks of the Augustines.</p>

<p>'In this college, temp. Henry VI., was bred up
John Arundell, a younger son of Renfry Arundell, of
Lanherne, Esquire, sheriff of Cornwall, 3rd Edward
IV., where he had the first taste of the liberal arts
and sciences, and was afterwards placed at Exon
College in Oxford, where he stayed till he took his
degree of Master of Arts, and then was presented
by his father to John Booth, Bishop of Exeter, to be
consecrated priest, and to have collation, institution,
and induct, into his rectory of St. Colomb. Which
being accordingly performed, and he resided upon,
this rectory glebe lands for some time, which gave
him opportunity to build the old parsonage house
still extant thereon, and moat the same round with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
rivers and fish-ponds, as Sir John Arundell, Knight,
informed me afterwards.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>If we are to accept the authority of Dallaway in
his 'History of the See of Chichester,' of the Rev.
Prebendary W. R. Stephens in his 'Memorials'
of that See, and of M. A. Lower in his 'Sussex
Worthies,' there was another member of this
branch of the family, also named John Arundell,
who attained to the dignity of the episcopal throne;
but his place in the pedigree is not easily to be identified,
and as the Rev. C. W. Boase truly remarks, it is
very difficult to distinguish between the John Arundells
of this time. He was one of the Physicians, as well
as Confessor and Domestic Chaplain, to Henry VI.
He was also Fellow of Exeter College, Oxon,
Proctor of University, and held many preferments
without cure of souls; and he was sometime Canon of
Windsor, Prebendary of Sarum, York and St. Paul's,
and Dean of Exeter. The King asked Pope
Calixtus III. to make him Bishop of Durham, but he
was, instead, made Bishop of Chichester, May, 1458.
He died in 1478, and bequeathed lands for the celebration
of his anniversary and of a nightly mass throughout
the year. Near the entrance into the choir of
Chichester Cathedral he erected a large altar tomb
of Petworth marble, ornamented with brasses
(probably since stolen), and at one time concealed
by pews. But a tablet was affixed to a pier near
the tomb, which gave some account of him, recording
that he left 'Benefield's lands' to found a
chantry. Lower also credits him with the erection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of the oratory between the nave and choir, and with
the 'Arundell' screen in 1477, which was removed
during the restorations in 1860.</p>

<p>The warrant for the appointment of himself and
colleagues to be the King's Physicians is in the
Cotton. MSS. (Vespasian G xiv. p. 415). In it
the medicines and other means of cure which the
professors of the healing art were (with the concurrence
of the Council) to employ are duly specified:
they included 'potiones, syrupi, confectiones, clysteria,
suppositoria, caputpurgea, gargarismata, balnea,
capitis rasura,' etc., etc., and the document affords a
curious glimpse of the state of the medical skill and
knowledge of the time. It is referred to by Johnson
in his 'Life of Linacre.' Unfortunately this Bishop's
Register is lost, but his career would seem to have
been uneventful.</p>

<p>To resume the story of the descent of the family.
The records which I have been able to consult
throw little or no light of importance upon most of the
immediate descendants of Richard II.'s Admiral; his
daughters married men of rank and title, such as the
Lords Marney and Daubeny, Sir Henry Strangways,
Sir William Capell, and Sir William Courtenay; and
one of them, Ellen, secured the affections of Ralph,
'The great Copplestone.' One son only, Thomas,
he had (or he may perchance have been a grandson);
he, like so many others of his race, was knighted at
a coronation, on this occasion the coronation of King
Richard III. John, his son, won his knighthood
too; but in a different fashion, for he was made knight-banneret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
for his valour in the field, at the sieges of
'Toronne' (Therouenne, 7 miles south of St. Omer)
and Tournay, wherein so many ostentatious deeds of
valour were performed on both sides. He died in
1545, and was buried in the church of St. Columb
Major, where there is a brass to his memory.</p>

<p>By his second wife, Katharine, daughter of Sir
Thomas Grenville, of Stow, Sir John had an
erudite daughter, Mary, whose fame is enshrined in
the pages of Ballard's 'Celebrated British Ladies.'
She is chiefly known by her translations, especially
of the 'Sayings and Doings of the Emperor Severus,'
which she dedicated to her father, 'pater honoratissimus;'
and some of her manuscripts are, I
believe, preserved in the Royal Library. She
married, first, Robert Radcliff, Earl of Sussex; and
secondly, Henry, 17th Earl of Arundell. One of the
successors of the learned lady, named Margaret, who
died in 1691, was buried in the Trerice Arundell vault
in Newlyn Church, at the east end of the south aisle;
and according to Davies Gilbert, it was through her
that the Trerice estates passed into the hands of their
present proprietor, Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, Bart.</p>

<p>Sir John's grandson, of the same name, next
claims a short notice. Dodd, in his 'Church History,'
says of him:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Sir John being an "occasional conformist," his
conversation with Mr. Cornelius had given him
(Cornelius) early impressions in favour of the
Catholic religion, which grew stronger in the University,
where he met with many of the same dispositions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
At length, being weary of a conformity
against his conscience, he left Oxford.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>This was that Father Cornelius who, so Foley
informs us, was born at Bodmin, of Irish parents,
and early attracted Sir John's attention by his
studious disposition. Sir John took him by the hand,
and always stood his friend. But Cornelius became
a Jesuit and a recusant, and was hung, drawn, and
quartered at Dorchester, in 1594. He was chaplain
to Lady Arundell after her husband's decease, and
she having recovered the body, gave it honourable
interment.</p>

<p>The favour in which Cornelius and other priests
about this time were held by our Sir John Arundell,
cost him his liberty. He was summoned to London
in 1581, and for nine years was kept a prisoner in
Ely Palace, Holborn, only leaving it to go down to
Isleworth and die. His body was conveyed to St.
Columb with great pomp, and there is a monument
there to his memory.</p>

<p>His daughters, Dorothy and Gertrude, entered the
Convent of Benedictine nuns at Brussels, in the year
1600, and the former wrote an account of the last
days of Father Cornelius, which part of his life
she appears to have spent with him.</p>

<p>From the knight-banneret of Tournay and
Therouenne descended the Arundells of Wardour;
who, on obtaining that estate and castle (whose
gallant defence by Lady Blanche Arundell, during
the Civil War, is familiar to the reader of romance
as well as to the historical student) by intermarriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
with the heiress of John, Lord Dinham and ceasing
to reside in Cornwall, the story of whose Worthies
I am endeavouring to tell, are not strictly speaking
included in my scheme; but they evidently remembered
with affection their Cornish origin, for on the
east front of old Wardour Castle is a Latin inscription,
of which the following is an uncouth
translation, believed to be by Henry, the eighth
Lord Arundell:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Here, branch of Arundell Lanhernian race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thomas first sat, and he deserved the place:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sat, and fell: Merit the fatal crime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Heav'n, to mark him faultless, bless'd his line.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Matthew his offspring, as the Father, Great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And happier in his Prince, regain'd the seat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confirm'd, enlarg'd; long may its fortune stand!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">HIS care who gave, resum'd, restor'd the land.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The above Matthew had a brother Charles, who
left England in 1583, on account of his attachment
to the Roman Catholic creed, visited Rome and
Spain, and finally died in Paris 9th December, 1587.</p>

<p>And here it may be well to add, that by the marriage
of Mary Arundell in 1739 to Henry, seventh Baron
Arundell of Wardour, the Lanherne and Wardour
branches of the family were, after a separation of
more than two centuries, re-united. At Wardour
are preserved numerous MSS. relating to the Arundell
family; a most interesting as well as extensive
series. It includes the Tywardreath Charter with
the Laocoön seal, various inventories of furniture,
household books, travelling expenses, tailor's bills,
etc., etc., to say nothing of court rolls, rentals,
surveys, etc., from the reign of Richard II. to that
of Henry VIII.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Thomas, a grandson of the friend of Father
Cornelius, 'when but a young man, signalized
himself so much by his valour against the Turks, in
Hungary, that the Emperor Rodolph II. raised
him to the dignity of a Count of the Empire in
1595: granting that his children, of both sexes,
and their descendants, should for ever enjoy that
rank; have a vote in all the diets of the Empire,
purchase lands within the dominion of the Empire,
raise volunteers, and not be put to any trial,
except in the Imperial Chamber. In forcing the
water-tower, near Gran (a formerly rich town of
Hungary), he took from the Turks their banner, with
his own hand; which banner, taken by Sir Thomas,
of Wardour, was preserved, as a trophy, in the
Vatican at Rome; where it remained till the French
revolution. This brave young knight was recommended
to the Emperor by Queen Elizabeth, in a
Latin letter, written by her own hand, which is still
kept at Wardour Castle.' King James I. made him
first Baron Arundell of Wardour in 1605. He died
at Wardour in 1639, æt. 79.</p>

<p>Another Sir John married his relative, an Arundell
of Trerice, namely Anna, the widow of John Trevanyon.
It is noteworthy that on this Sir John's
tomb in St. Columb churchyard he is styled baronet,
but there is no reason to believe that he reached
a higher dignity than that of knighthood.</p>

<p>The name was at length assumed by Richard
Beling, who married into a family more illustrious
than his own. But I believe this branch of the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
has now, too, become extinct; and it is said that the
last of the Lanherne Arundells died in Cornwall in
1766&mdash;a collector of the customs at Falmouth.</p>

<p>We now come to a very interesting phase of the
family history: I mean the results which followed
upon the attachment of this branch of the Arundells
to 'the old religion,' as the Roman Catholic faith
was called. It was exemplified by two episodes
which deserve attention: one was the tragic story of
Cuthbert Mayne, a recusant priest who was harboured
at Golden near Probus, in the residence of the old
Cornish family of Tregian, one of whom married
Catherine, daughter of a Sir John Arundell and his
wife, Elizabeth Dannet, and whose son Francis was
imprisoned for recusancy in the time of Elizabeth.
The story of Cuthbert Mayne is fully given in
Morris's 'Troubles of our Catholic Forefathers,' Dr.
Oliver's 'History of the Catholic Religion in the
West of England,'and by Challoner in his 'Memoirs
of Missionary Priests,' etc.</p>

<p>The second episode to which I have alluded is the
story of Humphry Arundell, the 'leader of the
Cornish rebellion'&mdash;a rising which was undertaken
for a like cause&mdash;the defence of 'the old religion.'
We are indebted to Mr. Froude for much valuable
information on this subject, given in the fifth vol.
of his 'History of England, from the fall of Wolsey
to the Death of Queen Elizabeth.'</p>

<p>In the summer of 1548 one of Henry VIII.'s Commissioners,
a Mr. Body, was murdered by a priest at
Helston in Cornwall, whilst the Commissioner was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
carrying out the King's command in removing certain
superstitious objects from the church. Some executions
followed, but the Cornishmen were neither
conciliated nor terrified thereby, and a rebellion was
concocted, Sir Humphry Arundell, of the Mount,
and Henry Boyer, Mayor of Bodmin, being the
leaders.</p>

<p>The rebellion was inaugurated at Sampford
Courtney, on Dartmoor, when the people compelled
the priests to say mass, notwithstanding that the
English liturgy was commanded to be used, for the
first time, on Whitsunday, 1549.</p>

<p>Lord Russell thereupon sends down Sir Peter and
Sir Gawen Carew to quell the insurrection, but in
June, 1549, 10,000 Cornishmen were in full march
on Exeter. England was, in fact, rising in all
directions, and the Commons of Devon and Cornwall
insisted on the restoration of the mass, and that
images should be set up again; the English Bibles
were also to be called in, 'for we be informed that
otherwise the clergy shall not of long time confound
the heretics,' etc., etc.; and they added a petition
that Humphrey Arundell and Henry Boyer should
have safe access to the King to represent their grievances.
Froude sets out the document in full. The
Protector insisted upon Bonner's (Bishop of London)
preaching a sermon condemning the rebellion,
especially so far as Cornwall and Devon were concerned,
and recanting his views as to the mass, etc.;
and Bonner's imprisonment was the well-known result.
Order was at length partially restored; but Exeter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
where there was a strong 'Catholic' party, was, in
July, actually besieged by the rebels, and they even
talked of going on to London with their army,
now 20,000 strong; but Exeter held out for six
weeks. Whilst Humphry Arundell was advancing
upon it, Carew brought the welcome tidings to Lord
Russell (at Honiton, the rallying-point) of the
advance of Lord Grey. Meanwhile a body of
Cornishmen had arrived at Fennington Bridge,
three miles from Exeter, where Sir Peter Carew
attacked them; and here Sir Gawen, who was with
him, was shot through the arm. The Cornishmen
were scattered after a severe struggle, leaving 300
dead on the field, and their assailants at least as
many; and Grey now came to the rescue of Exeter.
At the battle of St Mary's Clyst the King's troops,
though at first defeated, ultimately succeeded, and
killed 1,000 rebels, besides taking many prisoners,
who were afterwards put to the sword. The fight
was renewed on the following day, and Grey, who
had seen service, exclaimed that 'such was the
valour and the stoutness of the men, that he never, in
all the wars he had been in, did know the like.' But,
as we have said, the rebels were massacred; the siege
of Exeter was raised; and on the 6th of August the
banner of the red dragon was flying from the city walls.</p>

<p>Yet the Cornish rallied on Dartmoor, at Sampford
Courtney, under Humphry Arundell, Pomeroy,
Underhill, and others; and here at length, where the
fire was first kindled it was at last extinguished on
Sunday, 17th August, 1549. The town had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
fortified, and when the insurgents were driven back
to it, to use Lord Russell's own words: 'While I
was yet behind with the residue of the army conducting
the carriage, Humphry Arundel with his
whole power came on the back of our forewards,'
and 'against Arundel was nothing for one hour but
shooting of ordnance to and fro.' At length 'the
rebels' stomachs so fell from them as without any
blow they fled,' and multitudes of the unfortunate
wretches were slain. Humphrey Arundel fled to
Launceston, when he 'immediately began to practise
with the townsmen and the keepers of Greenfield and
other gentlemen for the murder of them that night.
The keepers so much abhorred this cruelty as they
immediately set the gentlemen at large, and gave
them their aid, with the help of the town for the
apprehension of Arundel, whom, with four or five
ringleaders, they have imprisoned.'</p>

<p>The insurgents lost over 4,000 men during this
fatal month. Martial law was proclaimed throughout
Devon and Cornwall; and Arundell, with three
others (Holmes, Winslow, and Berry), was hung at
Tyburn. Holmes says that Boyer, the Mayor of
Bodmin, was hung at his own door, after the
Provost Marshal had dined with him.</p>

<p>Hals's account of the rising is so full and interesting,
that it seems worth giving, even at the risk of
incurring some little repetition. He says:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'This Priory or Abbey (of St. Michael's Mount)
being dissolved by Act of Parliament, and given to
the King, 33rd Henry VIII., 1542, he gave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
revenues and government of the place to Humphry
Arundell, Esq., of the Lanherne family, who enjoyed
the same till the first year of King Edward VI.,
1549; at which time that King set forth several injunctions
about religion; amongst others, this was
one, viz.: That all images found in churches, for
divine worship or otherwise, should be pulled down
and cast forth out of those churches; and that all
preachers should perswade the people from praying
to saints, or for the dead, and from the use of beads,
ashes, processions, masses, dirges, and praying to
God publicly in an unknown tongue; and, least there
should be a defect of preachers as to these points,
homilies were made and ordered to be read in all
churches. Pursuant to this injunction, one Mr.
Body, a commissioner for pulling down images in
the churches of Cornwall, going to do his duty in
Helston Church, a priest, in company with Kiltor
of Kevorne, and others, at unawares stabbed him
in the body with a knife; of which wound he
instantly fell dead in that place. And though the
murderer was taken, and sent up to London, tried,
found guilty of murder in Westminster Hall, and
executed in Smithfield, yet the Cornish people
flocked together in a tumultuous and rebellious
manner, by the instigation of their priests in diverse
parts of the shire or county, and committed many
barbarities and outrages in the same; and though
the justices of the peace apprehended several of
them, and sent them to jail, yet they could not, with
all their power, suppress the growth of their insurrection;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
for soon after Humphry Arundell, aforesaid,
governor of this Mount, sided with those
mutineers, and broke out into actual rebellion
against his and their prince. The mutineers chose
him for the General of their army, and for inferior
officers as Captains, Majors, and Colonels, John Rosogan,
James Rosogan, Will. Winslade of Tregarrick
or St. Agnes at Mithian, John Payne of St. Ives,
Robert Bochym of Bochym, and his brother,
Thomas Underhill, John Salmon, William Segar,
together with several priests, rectors, vicars, and
curates of churches, as John Thompson, Roger
Barret, John Woolcock, William Asa, James
Mourton, John Barrow, Richard Bennet, and
others, who mustered their soldiers according to the
rules of the military discipline at Bodmin, where the
general rendezvous was appointed. But no sooner
was the General Arundell departed from St. Michael's
Mount to exert his power in the camp and field
aforesaid, but diverse gentlemen, with their wives
and families, in his absence possessed themselves
thereof; whereupon he dispatched a party of horse
and foot to reduce his old garrison, which quickly
they effected, by reason the besieged wanted provision
and ammunition, and were distracted with
the women and children's fears and cries; and so
they yielded the possession to their enemies on condition
of free liberty of departing forthwith from
thence with life, though not without being plundered.</p>

<p>'The retaking of St. Michael's Mount by the
General Arundell proved much to the content and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
satisfaction of his army at Bodmin, consisting of
about 6,000 men, which they looked upon as a
good omen of their future success, and the firstfruits
of the valour and conduct of their General.
Whereupon the confederates daily increased his
army with great numbers of men from all parts,
who listed themselves under his banner, which
was not only pourtrayed, but by a cart brought into
the field for their encouragement, viz., a pyx under
its canopy; that is to say, the vessel containing the
Roman host, or sacramental sacrifice, or body of
Christ, together with crosses, banners, candlesticks,
holy bread and water, to defend them from devils
and the adverse power (see "Fox's Martyrology,"
p. 669), which was carried whersoever the camp removed,
which camp grew so tremendously formidable
at Bodmin, that Job Militon Esq., then Sheriff of
Cornwall, with all the power of his bailiwick, durst
not encounter with it during the time of the General's
stay in that place, which gave him and his rebels
opportunity to consult together for the good of their
public interest, and to make out a declaration, or
manifesto, of the justice of their cause and grounds
of taking up arms; but the army, in general
consisting of a mixed multitude of men of diverse
professions, trades, and employments, could not
easily agree upon the subject matter, and form
thereof. Some would have no justice of the peace;
for that generally they were ignorant of the laws, and
could not construe or English a Latin bill of indictment
without the clerk of the peace's assistance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
who imposed upon them, with other attorneys, for
gain, wrong sense, and judgment&mdash;besides, in themselves,
they were corrupt and partial in determining
cases; others would have no lawyers nor attorneys,
for that the one cheated the people in wrong advice
or counsel, and the other of their money by extravagant
bills of costs; others would have no court leets,
or court-barons, for that the cost and expense in
prosecuting an action at law therein was many times
greater than the debt or profit. But generally it was
agreed upon amongst them that no inclosure should
be left standing, but that all lands should be held in
common; yet what expedients should be found out
and placed in the room of those several orders and
degrees of men and officers none could prescribe.</p>

<p>'However, the priests, rectors, vicars, and curates,
the priors and monks, friars and other dissolved
collegiates, hammered out seven articles of address
for the King's Majesty, upon grant of which they
declared their bodies, arms, and goods should all be
at his disposal, viz.:</p>

<p>'No. 1. That curates should administer baptism at
all times of need, as well week days as holy days.</p>

<p>'2. That their children might be confirmed by the
Bishop.</p>

<p>'3. That mass might be celebrated, no man communicating
with the priest.</p>

<p>'4. That they might have reservation of the Lord's
body in churches.</p>

<p>'5. That they might have holy bread and water
in remembrance of Christ's body and blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>'6. That priests might not be married.</p>

<p>'7. That the six articles set forth by King Henry
VIII. might be continued at least till the King came
of age.</p>

<p>'Now these six articles were invented by Stephen
Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester (who was the
bastard son of Lionel Woodvill, Bishop of Salisbury,
by his concubine, Elizabeth Gardiner; the
which Lionel was fifth son of Richard Woodvill, Earl
Rivers, 1470), and therefore called his creed, viz.:</p>

<p>'1. That the body of Christ is really present in
the sacrament after consecration.</p>

<p>'2. That the sacrament cannot truly be administered
under both kinds.</p>

<p>'3. That priests entered into holy orders might
not marry.</p>

<p>'4. That vows of chastity entered into upon
mature deliberation, were to be kept.</p>

<p>'5. That private masses were not to be omitted.</p>

<p>'6. That auricular confession was necessary in the
Church of God.</p>

<p>'To these demands of the Cornish rebels the King
so far condescended as to send an answer in writing
to every article, and also a general pardon to every
one of them, if they would lay down arms. (See
Fox's "Acts and Monuments," Book IX. p. 668). But,
alas! those overtures of the King were not only
rejected by the rebels, but made them the more bold
and desperate; especially finding themselves unable
longer to subsist upon their own estates and money,
or the bounty of the country, which hitherto they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
had done. The General therefore resolved, as the
fox who seldom chucks at home, to prey upon other
men's goods and estates farther off for his army's
better subsistence. Whereupon he dislodged from
Bodmin, and marched with his soldiers into Devon,
where Sir Peter Carew, Knight, was ready to obstruct
their passage with his posse comitatus. But when
they saw the order and discipline of the rebels, and
that their army consisted of above 6,000 fighting-men,
desperate, well armed, and prepared for battle,
the Sheriff and his troops permitted them quietly to
pass through the heart of that country to Exeter,
where the citizens, upon notice of their approaches
(as formerly done), shut the gates, and put themselves
in a posture of defence.</p>

<p>'Things being in this posture, the General, Arundell,
summoned the citizens to deliver their town and
castle to his dominion; but they sent him a flat
denial. Whereupon, forthwith he ordered his men
to fire the gates of the city, which accordingly they
did; but the citizens on the inside supplied those
fires with such quantities of combustible matter, so
long till they had cast up a half-moon on the inside
thereof, upon which, when the rebels attempted to
enter, they were shot to death or cut to pieces.
Their entrance being thus obstructed at the gates,
they put in practice other expedients, viz., either to
undermine the walls or blow them up with barrels of
gunpowder, which they had placed in the same;
but the citizens also prevented this their design, by
countermining their mines and casting so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
water on the places where their powder-barrels were
lodged, that the powder would not take fire. Thus
stratagems of war were daily practised between the
besieged and besiegers to the great hurt and damage
of each other.</p>

<p>'King Edward being informed by his council of
this siege, and that there was little or no dependance
upon the valour and conduct of the Sheriff of Devon
and his bailiwick to suppress this rebellion or raise
the siege of Exeter, granted his commission to John
Lord Russell, created Baron Russell of Tavistock by
King Henry, and Lord High Admiral and Lord
Privy Seal, an old experienced soldier who had lost
an eye at the Siege of Montreuil in France, to be
his General for raising soldiers to fight those rebels;
who forthwith, pursuant thereto, raised a considerable
army and marched them to Honiton; but when
he came there he was informed that the enemy consisted
of 10,000 able fighting-men armed; which
occasioned his halting there longer than he intended,
expecting greater supplies of men, that were coming
to his aid under conduct of the Lord Grey; which
at length arrived and joined his forces, whereupon
he dislodged from thence and marched towards
Exeter; where, on the way, he had several sharp
conflicts with the rebels with various success, sometimes
the better and sometimes the worse; though
at length after much fatigue of war, maugre all opposition
and resistance of the rebels, he forced them to
raise their siege, and entered the city of Exeter with
relief, 6th August, 1549, after thirty-two days' siege,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
wherein the inhabitants had valiantly defended themselves,
though in that extremity they were necessitated
by famine to eat horses, moulded cloth, and
bread made of bran; in reward of whose loyalty
King Edward gave to the city for ever the Manor of
Evyland, since sold by the city for making the river
Exe navigable.</p>

<p>'After raising the siege, as aforesaid, the General,
Arundell, rallied his routed forces of rebels, and gave
battle to the Lord Russell and the King's army with
that inveterate courage, animosity, and resolution,
that the greatest part of his men were slain upon the
spot, others threw down their arms on mercy, the
remainder fled, and were afterwards many of them
taken and executed. Sir Anthony Kingston, Knight,
a Gloucestershire man, after this rebellion, was made
Provost-Marshal for executing such western rebels as
could be taken, or were made prisoners in Cornwall
and Devon, together with all such who had been
aiders or assisters of them in that rebellion; upon
whom, according to his power and office, he executed
martial law with sport and justice (as Mr. Carew
and other historians tell us); and the principal
persons that have come to my knowledge, over whose
misery he triumphed, was Boyer, the Mayor of
Bodmin; Mayow of Clevyan, in St. Colomb Major,
whom he hanged at the tavern sign-post in that
town, of whom tradition saith his crime was not
capital; and, therefore, his wife was advised by her
friends to hasten to the town after the Marshal and
his men, who had him in custody, and beg his life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Which, accordingly, she prepared to do, and to
render herself the more amiable petitioner before the
Marshal's eyes, this dame spent so much time in
attiring herself and putting on her French hood, then
in fashion, that her husband was put to death before
her arrival. In like manner the Marshal hanged one
John Payne, the Mayor, or Portreeve of St. Ives,
on a gallows erected in the middle of that
town, whose arms are still to be seen in one of
the foreseats in that church, viz. in a plain field
three pine-apples. Besides those he executed many
more in other places in Cornwall, that had been
actors, assisters, or promoters of this rebellion.
Lastly, it is further memorable of this Sir Anthony
Kingston, that in Sir John Heywood's chronicle he
is taxed of extreme cruelty in doing his Marshal's
office aforesaid. Of whom Fuller, in Gloucestershire,
gives us this further account of him; that
afterwards, in the reign of Queen Mary, being
detected, with several others, of a design to rob her
exchequer, though he made his escape and fled into
his own country, yet there he was apprehended and
taken into custody by a messenger, who was bringing
him up to London in order to have justice done
upon him for his crime; but he being conscious of his
guilt, and despairing of pardon, so effectually poisoned
himself that he died on the way, without having the
due reward of his desert.</p>

<p>'After the death of Humphrey Arundell, Governor
of St. Michael's Mount, executed for treason as
aforesaid, King Edward VI. sold or gave the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and revenues thereof to Job Militon, Esq.,
aforesaid, then Sheriff of Cornwall, during his life;
but his son, dying without issue male, the government,
by what title I know not, devolved upon
the Bassets of Tihidy, from some of whom, as I am
informed, it came by purchase to Sir John St.
Aubyn, Bart., now in possession thereof.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>A contemporary account of Humphrey Arundell's
execution in Mr. Richard Howlett's 'Monumenta
Franciscana,' vol. ii., 27th January, 1550, states: 'Was
drawne from the Tower of London vnto Tyborne
iiii persons (Humfre Avrnedelle, Bere Vynch, Chyffe,
Homes), and there hangyd and qwarterd, and
their qwarteres sette abowte London on euery
gatte; thes was of them that dyd ryse in the West
cuntre.'</p>

<p>It has already been observed that an attachment
to the Roman Catholic faith led many of the
Arundells into trouble: as exemplifying this, I have
culled a few other instances from the pages of a
writer belonging to that Communion.</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'The next successor to the property' (a son of
John Arundell, the friend of Father Cornelius), 'was
indeed a great sufferer for conscience' sake. In a
letter before me of F. Richard Blount, dated 7th
Nov., 1606, he says that Mr. Arundell, amongst
others, had been forced to compound for the possession
of his property by paying heavy fines to the
Crown. He had been convicted of recusancy, but
King James directed by his letters patent (20 Feb.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
4 Jac. I., 1607) that none of Mr. Arundell's lands
were to be seized so long as he paid £240 a year
for not frequenting church,' etc.</p>

<p>'George Arundell was another recusant (20 June,
34 Eliz., 1591), and paid a similar fine.</p>

<p>'From a letter in the State Paper Office, dated 21
Oct., 1642, by a Parliamentarian, I make the following
extract:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'"Mr. Arundell hath the greatest forces here, and
is able to raise more than half the gentlemen in
Cornwall, and he alone was the first that began the
rebellion there. There hath lately been landed at
some creek in that county ten or more seminary
priests, which are newly come out of Flanders, and
harboured in Mr. Arundell's house.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> They are
merciless creatures, and there is a great way laid for
the apprehension of them."</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'This gentleman had to suffer the sequestration of
his estates for many years, and it cost him nearly
£3,000 to get off at last.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>And the continued attachment of the Arundells to
their ancient faith is exemplified in an interesting
manner, as we shall see further on, by the conventual
establishment still existing at Lanherne.</p>

<p>A few words will perhaps be expected as to the
church, and the adjacent former residence of the
Arundells of Lanherne. The sylvan beauty of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
situation and its surroundings has already been
adverted to, and the church and churchyard, at
least, are still worthy of their site; but little remains
of the once noble old mansion, of which Carew
wrote: 'This said house of Lanherne is apportioned
with a large scope of land, which, while
the owners there lived, was employed to frank
hospitality.'</p>

<p>At <span class="smcap">Mawgan Church</span> the fragments of the screen
which separates the nave and south aisle are carved
with the arms of Arundell quartering Carminow,
and on the south side of the chancel are brass shields
on which the same arms are quartered with Archdekne,
Arches, Carminow, Denham, Durnford, Grenville,
etc. At the east end of the aisle on the screen
are seven brass plates, 'chiefly inscribed with
English and Latin verses, admonitory to the reader
and eulogistic of the Arundells,' <em>e.g.</em>:</p>

<div class="poem5 small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'What favour FORTUNE him affords, his landes and livings tell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of brethren five, though youngst he were, to lyve yet had he well.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where unto GRACE &amp; GOD he yealds the price and prayse for aye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What FORTUNE or dame NATURE gave, DEATH having tane away.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The transept, or Arundell chapel, was once used as
a burial-place for the nuns of the adjoining nunnery;
it has a hagioscopic communication with the chancel.</p>

<p>The following inscription on a brass, the chief
portion of which is now missing, has also been
preserved:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1-5" />

 etc., &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Nearly the whole of the older Arundell brasses,
which bore the names, dates of death, and ages of the
members of that family are not now to be found in the
church; one, a sort of palimpsest brass, bore on one
side an acrostic to the memory of Jane Arundell, and
on the other a representation of the Deity, and two
other figures, probably symbolical. This brass is
said to have been removed to the nunnery at the
beginning of the present century.</p>

<p>LANHERNE HOUSE, formerly the manor-house
of the Arundells, a picturesque but gloomy structure, is
now a Roman Catholic Carmelite nunnery, 'by time
unstricken, yet with ages hoar.' The south part of
the house is the most ancient part; it has stone-mullioned
windows, and a good doorway of Catacleuse
stone.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The vane which still surmounts the dome
represents a wolf&mdash;the crest of the Trembleath
Arundells. About eighty years ago the building was
assigned to sixteen nuns who fled from the siege of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Antwerp by the French during the revolutionary
wars; and their successors, now over twenty in
number, continue to occupy the buildings.</p>

<hr class="r15" />
<h3><em>THE ARUNDELLS OF TRERICE.</em><a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></h3>

<p class="noindent">As the crow flies, Trerice, anciently Treres, as Carew
informs us, is about five miles south of Lanherne and
about the same distance from the mouth of the Gannel,
one of whose tributary streamlets runs round the
slope on whose southern side still stands great part
of the handsome and extensive mansion of this
branch of the family. It is not the original building,
dating as it does only from the year 1573; but its
charming and sheltered situation, 'its costly and
commodious dwellings,' the rich colours of the time-stained
masonry, its huge mullioned windows, and
the magnificent proportions of its large and lofty
hall, stamp it as one of the few remaining mansions
of the Cornish gentry that speak of the wealth and
power and hospitality of the 'good old times.'</p>

<p>The county histories are almost silent as to the
early seat of this branch of the family; but there is
no reason to doubt that its <em>site</em> remains the same;
and that Trerice was inhabited by an Arundell at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
least so far back as the reign of Edward III.&mdash;one
Ralph being here, whilst his cousin (or perhaps his
brother), Sir John, who married Elizabeth Carminow,
held sway at Lanherne.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Apropos of this
marriage into the powerful and wealthy family of
Carminow, it is interesting to note that in the
Register of Walter de Stapeldon, Bishop of Exeter,
and founder of Exeter College, Oxon, we find that,
in the year 1316, 'on the Monday before Michaelmas,
our lord' (the Bishop) 'offered his niece, Joan Kaignes,
as wife to John de Arundell, son and heir of John
de Arundell defunct, who refused for the present;
William Walle was present.' Were John's affections
already pledged to the fair Elizabeth? The incident
shows at least that the Bishop was desirous of
forming an alliance between one of his own relatives
and a house so important as that of Arundell.</p>

<p>Hals says that the Arundells of Trerice bore, at
one time, the arms of Lansladron, viz., sable, three
chevrons argent; but that at length they adopted the
well-known coat of the family: sable, six swallows
argent&mdash;three, two, and one.</p>

<p>Leland, writing of the Arundells of Trerice,
observes: 'This Arundale giveth no part of the
arms of the great Arundale of Lanheron, by St.
Columbe. But he told me that he thought he cam
of the Arundales in base Normandy, that were lordes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of <em>Culy Castelle</em>;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> that now is descended to one
Monseir de la Fontaine, a Frenchman, by heir
generale. This Arundale is caulid Arundale of
Trerise, by a difference from Arundale of Lanheron.
Trerise is a lordship of his, a three or four miles
from Alein chirch.'</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'What Leland means,' observes Tonkin, 'by his
first words I cannot imagine. The then owner of
Trerise was <em>Sir John Arundell</em>, who could not tell
him that his arms were different from Arundells of
Lanhearn, since it is most certain that they constantly
gave the same, viz., the six swallows, and
that without any difference or distinction, as not
being well agreed on which was the elder family of
the two; only, as it is before observed, Arundell of
Trerice, the better to declare of what house he was,
did always quarter the arms of Trerice with his own.
Nay, further; as appeareth by a very fair pedigree
of this family, drawn up by Mr. Camden himself,
which was lately in the Lord Arundell's library,
where I had the favour to peruse it, the ancestor
of the Lanhearn family, which came over with
William the Conqueror, left a widow, afterwards
married to the ancestor of Arundell of Trerice, that
came over at the same time; so that both these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
families are descended from that same woman. But
as she was first married to the ancestor of Arundell
of Lanhearne, it is supposed from thence that he
was descended from the elder brother, and the other
from the younger, as being both of the same stock;
which is further confirmed, for that Arundell of
Lanhearn had always the greater estate, and made
the greater figure in their country, whence they
were called the <em>Great Arundells</em>, though this of
Trerice was likewise very eminent.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Carew, who married into the family of the
Tolverne Arundells, and who may therefore be
assumed to be of some authority in the matter, does
not go so far back as this for the rise of the Arundells
of Trerice. He says, 'In Edward III.'s
reign, Ralph Arundel matched with the heir of this
land and name; since which time his issue hath
there continued, and increased their livelihood by
sundry like inheritors as St. John, Jew, Durant, Thurlebear,'
etc. He adds, 'Precisely to rip up the whole
pedigree were more tedious than behooveful; and
therefore I will only (as by the way) touch some few
points which may serve, in part, to show what place
and regard they have borne in the commonwealth.'</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>I venture to think that, so far as modern readers
are concerned, it will be well to adopt Carew's view;
and that the more especially on account of the
many difficulties which beset the case, as already
mentioned at the commencement of this chapter. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
do not therefore propose to advert to the Sir Oliver
de Arundell of Carhayes of the time of Henry III.,
who married a lady of the same patronymic as himself,
and who indeed was probably the true founder
of the Trerice branch; but will at once mention, as
the first historical representative of this part of the
family, a Sir John Arundell of Trerice, Sheriff of
Cornwall, who, early in the fifteenth century, viz.
in the seventh year of Henry V., accompanied the
Earl of Devon on a sea voyage 'in defence of the
realm;' no doubt the same knight who was in the
following reign addressed by the Earl of Huntingdon&mdash;Lieutenant-General
to John, Duke of Bedford,
Constable and Admiral of England&mdash;as 'Vice-Admiral
of Cornwall.' I do not, however, feel
certain whether it was he or his son (but more
probably the latter) whose curious story has been
thus narrated by Hals and by Carew.</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>Hals says, 'As soon as King Edward IV. heard
of the surprise of St. Michael's Mount by the Earl
of Oxford, he issued forth his proclamation, proclaiming
him, and all his adherents, traitors, and
then consulted how to regain both to his obedience;
and in order thereto, he forthwith sent Sir John
Arundell of Trerice, Knight, then Sheriff of Cornwall,
to reduce and besiege the same by his posse comitatus;
which gentleman, pursuant to his orders and by
virtue of his office, soon rose a considerable army of
men and soldiers within his bailiwick, and marched
with them towards St. Michael's Mount, where,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
being arrived, he sent a trumpeter to the Earl with
a summons of surrender of that garrison to him for
King Edward, upon mercy; especially for that in
so doing, in all probability he would prevent the
effusion of much Christian blood. To this summons
of the trumpeter the Earl sent a flat denial; saying
further that, rather than he would yield the fort on
those terms, himself and those with him were all
resolved to lose their lives in defence thereof.
Whereupon the Sheriff commanded his soldiers,
being very numerous on all parts, to storm the
Mount and reduce it by force; but alas, maugre all
their attempts (of this kind), the besieged so well
defended every part of this rocky mountain, that in
all places the Sheriff's men were repulsed with some
loss; and the besieged issued forth from the outer
gate and pursued them with such violence that the
said Sir John Arundell and some others were slain
upon the sands at the foot of the Mount, to the great
discouragement of the new-raised soldiers, who
quickly departed thence, having lost their leader,
leaving the besieged in better heart than they
found them, as much elevated at their good success
as themselves were dismayed at their bad fortune.'</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Sir John Arundell,' as Mr. Carew, in his 'Survey
of Cornwall,' tells us, p. 119, 'had long before been
told, by some fortune-teller, that he would be slain
on the sands; wherefore, to avoid that destiny, he
removed from Efford, near Stratton, on the sands,
where he dwelt, to Trerice, far off from the sea-sands;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
yet by this misfortune fulfilled the prediction
in another place.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The connexion of this family with Stratton and
Bude is further indicated by the churchwardens'
accounts of Stratton Church, where knells were rung
in 1526 for the <em>Arundells</em>; they are also recorded as
having presented vestments to this church.</p>

<p>That the Arundells of Trerice long continued in
Royal favour is evident from the fact that one of the
family&mdash;a Sir John, a name to which all branches of
the Arundells seem to have been extremely partial&mdash;received
an autograph letter from the Queen of
Henry VII., dated 12th October, 1488, wherein her
Majesty informs the knight that she has been safely
delivered of a prince.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We now arrive at some Arundells who make a
greater figure in history than any of those who
preceded them; and who, like their forefathers, seem
to have stood well at Court. For in 1520, we find
King Henry VIII. writing to Sir John Arundell of
Trerice, his Esquire of the body&mdash;'Jack of Tilbury'&mdash;that
he should give his attendance at Canterbury
about the entertainment of the Emperor, whose landing
on the English coast was then shortly expected.</p>

<p>Three years afterwards the same knight took
prisoner Duncan Campbell, a notorious Scottish
pirate, in a fight at sea, 'as our chronicle mentioneth;'<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
concerning which, 'I thought it not amiss,' says Carew,
'to insert a letter sent him from Thomas, Duke of
Norfolk (to whom he then belonged), that you may
see the style of those days.</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>It is singular that (so far as I am aware) there is
so little recorded in history of an action to which so
much importance was evidently attributed at the time
of its performance.</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'And in 35th Henry VIII.,' continues Carew, 'the
King wrote to Sir John Arundell of Trerice, touching
his discharge from the Admiralty of the fleet, lately
committed unto him, and that he should deliver the
ship which he sailed in, to Sir Nicholas Poynts. The
same year the King wrote to him again, that he
should attend him in his wars against the French
King, with his servants, tenants, and others, within
his rooms and offices, especially horsemen. Other
letters from the King there are, whose date is not
expressed, neither can I by any means hunt it out.
One to his servant, John Arundell of Trerice, Esquire,
willing him not to repair with his men, and to wait in
the rearward of his army, as he had commanded
him, but to keep them in a readiness for some other
service. Another to Sir John Arundell of Trerice,
praying and desiring him to the Court, the Quindene
of St. Hillary next, wheresoever the King shall then
be within the realm.</p>

<p>'There are also letters, directed to Sir John Arundell
of Trerice, from the King's Counsel; by some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
which it appeareth, that (temp. Edward VI.) he was
Vice-Admiral of the King's ships in the west seas;
and by others that he had the goods and lands of
certain rebels given him, for his good service against
them.</p>

<p>'Again the Queen, 1st of Mary (1553), wrote
to Sir John Arundell of Trerice, praying and
requiring him that he, with his friends and neighbours,
should see the Prince of Spain most
honourably entertained, if he fortuned to land in
Cornwall. She also wrote to him (being then
Sheriff of Cornwall, 2nd Mary) touching the
election of the Knights of the Shire, and the
burgesses for the Parliament. She likewise once
more wrote to him (2nd and 3rd Philip and
Mary) that (notwithstanding the instructions to the
justices) he should muster, and furnish with servants,
tenants, and others, under his rule and offices, with
his friends, for the defence and quieting of the
country, withstanding of enemies, and any other
employment; as also to certify what force of horse
and foot he could arm.</p>

<p>'These few notes,' Carew says, 'I have culled
out of many others. Sir John Arundell, last
mentioned, by his first wife, the co-heir of Bevill,
had issue Roger, who died in his father's lifetime;
and Katherine, married to Prideaux. Roger, by
his wife Trendenham, left behind him a son called
John. Sir John's second wife was daughter to
Erisy, and widow to Gourlyn, who bare him
John, his succeeder in Trerice, and much other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
fair revenues, whose due commendation, because
another might better deliver than myself, who
touch him as nearly as Tacitus did Agricola, I
will, therefore, bound the same within his desert,
and only say this, which all who knew him, shall
testify with me; that, of his enemies, he would
take no wrong, nor on them any revenge; and
being once reconciled, embraced them, without
scruple or remnant of gall. Over his kindred, he
held a wary and charey care, which bountifully was
expressed, when occasion so required: reputing himself
not only principal of the family, but a general
father to them all. Private respects ever, with him,
gave place to the common good: as for frank, well-ordered,
and continual hospitality, he outwent all
show of competence: spare, but discreet of speech,
better conceiving than delivering; equally stout, and
kind, not upon lightness of humour, but soundness
of judgment; inclined to commiseration, ready to
relieve. Briefly, so accomplished in virtue, that
those, who for many years together waited in nearest
place about him, and, by his example, learned to
hate untruth, have often deeply protested, how no
curious observation of theirs could ever descry in
him any one notorious vice. By his first foreremembered
wife he had four daughters, married to Carew
(the writer himself), Summaster, Cosowarth, and
Denham: by his latter, the daughter of Sir Robert
Denis, two sons and two daughters; the elder, even
from his young years, began where his father left, and
with so temperate a course, treadeth just in his footsteps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
that he inheriteth, as well his love as his
living. The younger brother followeth the Netherland
wars, with so well-liked a carriage, that he outgoeth
his age and time of service in preferment.
Their mother equalleth her husband's former
children, and generally all his kindred, in kind usage,
with her own, and is by them all, again, so acknowledged
and respected.'</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But here we are anticipating a little, and must
return to the hero of the engagement with the Scotch
pirate. The victor was at length himself vanquished
by the all-conquering one; and Sir John's monument
is still to be seen in Stratton Church, in which
place he was buried, probably either from his connexion
with the Grenvilles<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>&mdash;great patrons of that
church as well as of all the other churches in the
neighbourhood&mdash;or else, perhaps on account of his
family having resided at Ebbingford (Efford) near
Bude Haven, hard by. Indeed, one Raynulfe Arundell
was lord of Albaminster and Stratton so early
as the days of Henry III.</p>

<p>On Sir John Arundell's tomb in Stratton Church
he is represented in brass, lying between his two
wives&mdash;Mary Beville, of Talland, and Juliana Erisey,
of Erisey. Below the feet of his first wife stand the
sons, Richard, John, and Roger; under the second
are ranged the daughters, 'Margereta, Marie, Jane,
Phelipe, Grace, Margeri, and Annes.' The inscription
is:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p class="small">'Here lyeth buryed Sir John Arundell, Treryse, Knyght, who,

yeare of oure Lorde God a MCCCCCLXI., and in the III<sup>xx</sup> and VII
yeare of his age, whose soule now resteth with the faythfull Chrystians
in our Lorde.'</p>

<p>Carew has told us something of 'Jack of Tilbury's'
son John, but only makes a short reference to a
Sir Thomas Arundell, who I cannot help thinking
must have been one of the Trerice family, although
some authorities refer him to the Lanherne branch.
He was, together with Sir John Tregonwell and
others, appointed, in 1535, to be a Commissioner for
the suppression of all religious houses 'of the sume
of ccc marks and under;' and the rough reception
which they met with at the Priory of St. Nicholas,
Exeter, may be read in Dr. Oliver's 'Monasticon
Diocesis Exoniensis,' p. 116.</p>

<p>He had been one of Wolsey's Gentlemen of the
Privy Chamber, was made Knight of the Bath at
Anne Boleyn's coronation, and was appointed Receiver-General
of the Duchy of Cornwall, 1549.</p>

<p>He and his elder brother, John, were committed
to the Tower (1549-50) for implication in
the Humphry Arundell rebellion in January, but
were released October, 1551. He was, however,
re-committed to the Tower in the same month,
accused of being concerned in the Duke of
Somerset's conspiracy, wherein, Bishop Pouet says,
'Arundell conspired with that ambitious and subtil
Alcibiades, the Earl of Warwick, after Duke of
Northumberland, to pull down the good Duke of
Somerset, King Edward's uncle and protector.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
But, as Mr. Doyne Bell points out, in his 'History
of the Church of St. Peter ad Vincula, in the Tower,'
if this be correct, it is singular that he should have
been afterwards re-arrested for conspiring with
Somerset against Northumberland.</p>

<p>He was brought to trial with Sir Ralf Vane, and
tried on the following day, viz., 29th January, 1551-52,
when Machyn records that 'the quest qwytt ym of
tresun, and cast hym of felonye, to be hanged.'
Mr. Perne (probably the Prior of the Black Friars)
'was allowed to resort to Sir Thomas to instruct
hym to dye well.'</p>

<p>We read in Mr. Richard Howlett's 'Monumenta
Franciscana,' that, in the '<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chronicon ab anno 1189
ad 1556, ex registro Fratrum Minorum Londoniæ,</span>'
under date 26th February, 1552, is recorded that on
that day, 'the wyche was Fryday, was hongyd at
Towre-hylle sir Myllys Partryge, knyghte, the wyche
playd with Kynge Henry the viii<sup>te</sup> at dysse for the
grett belfery that stode in Powlles churche-yerde;

theis iiii. Knyghtes confessyd that the war neuer
gylte for soche thynges as was layd vn-to their
charge, and dyde in that same oppinioun.' He was
buried in the chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula, in the
Tower.</p>

<p>The Commission for seizing on the possessions in
Cornwall and Devon of Sir Thomas Arundell, 'rebel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and traitor,' is preserved amongst the Harleian MSS.
in the British Museum (433, art. 1557); and an interesting
catalogue of his plate, together with a list
of that portion which was returned to his wife,
Margaret, on 11th June, 1557, will be found in the
Add. MSS. 5751.</p>

<p>I think, but am by no means clear on the point,
that this is the Arundell to whom Henry VIII.
granted, on 6th June, 1545, Scilly, and the monastery
of Tavistock, and to whom, in the same year, the
King wrote a remarkable letter concerning the Papists
in Cornwall, which is preserved amongst the MSS.
at Westminster.</p>

<p>Carew thus refers to his fate: 'Sir Thomas
Arundel, a younger brother of Lanhearn House,
married the sister to Queen Katharine Howard,
and in Edward VI.'s time was made a Privy
Counsellor; but cleaving to the Duke of Somerset,
he lost his head with him.' But Carew
does not mention, to the credit of his elder
brother John, how (as we read in T. Wright's
'Queen Elizabeth and Her Times,' i. 507-8) the
Earl of Bedford, writing to Lord Burghley from
Truro, on 3rd August, 1574, reports that, the
Spanish navy being now ready for sea, Sir John
Arundell and others met him eight miles from
Plymouth, and accompanied him throughout his
visit to Cornwall; the object of which seems to
have been an inspection of the defences. The Earl
reports that he found Sir John 'ready and serviceable
in all things.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting member of the family
is the man who now appears upon the scene, the
grandson of 'Jack of Tilbury,' and son of the foregoing
Sir John. I mean 'John for the King,' the
valiant hero who held Pendennis Castle so stoutly
for Charles I. He was the son of John Arundell
of Trerice, by his second wife, Gertrude Dennys, of
Holcombe; and Richard Carew, the historian of
Cornwall, married his half-sister, Julian.</p>

<p>Unless I am much mistaken, he was present&mdash;or
if not he, it must have been his son Richard, who
was also at Edgehill and at Lansdowne&mdash;with most
of the Cornish gentry, including Sir Bevil Grenville,
Trevanion, and others, at the victory obtained by
the King's forces over the army of the Parliament, in
1623, on Braddock Downs&mdash;a fight which I have
endeavoured to describe in the chapter on the Grenvilles.</p>

<p>At any rate, twenty years later, Colonel John
Arundell, of Trerice, in Newlyn,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> was appointed
Governor of Pendennis Castle, in succession to
Sir Nicholas Slanning, who fell at the siege of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Bristol. According to some accounts he was then
sixty-seven years of age, according to others eighty-seven;
but the former is no doubt correct. Here, in
the following year, he harboured for a night or two
the unfortunate Queen Henrietta Maria, on her
flight into France from Exeter (where she had just
been confined of a prince) before the army of the Earl
of Essex. The then Sheriff of Cornwall thus writes
to his wife, Lady Francis Basset,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> on the occasion:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right small">'This thyrd of July, 1644. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /></p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Deare Wiffe</span>,</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Here is the woefullest spectacle my eyes yet
ever look'd on; the most worne and weak pitifull
creature in ye world, the poore Queene shifting for
one hour's liffe longer.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>And here John Arundell also received the Prince,
afterwards Charles II., in February, 1646. A room
in the castle still retains the name of the King's
Room.</p>

<p>The story of the siege has been admirably detailed
by Captain Oliver, R.A., in his 'Pendennis and
St. Mawes: an Historical Sketch of Two Cornish
Castles.' On the 17th March, 1646, Fairfax took up
his quarters at Arwenack House, the ancient seat of
the Killigrews, as we shall see in the account of that
family; the Killigrews themselves were within the
castle walls. To Fairfax's summons to deliver up Pendennis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the gallant old Arundell gave, as might have
been expected, 'a peremptory denyall,' saying (according
to a contemporary, and not a friendly, account)
that 'hee was 70 yeares old, and could not have
many days to live, and therefore would not in his
old yeares blemish his honour in surrendering thereof,
and would rather be found buried in the ruines
thereof, than commit so vilde a treason.' And so,
with his brave garrison, 'all desperate persons and
good soldiers ... many very considerable men ... and
the violentest enemies that the Parliament
hathe in this kingdom,' Arundell prepared to withstand
the siege. Fairfax's haughty summons demanded
a reply within <em>two hours</em>, and this was the
answer he got&mdash;(it is preserved among the Clarendon
State Papers):&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1-5" />

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; '<em>Colonel John Arundell to Sir Thomas Fairfax.</em></p>

and my age of seventy summons me hence shortly.
Yet I shall desire no other testimony to follow my
departure than my conscience to God and loyalty to
his Majesty, whereto I am bound by all the obligations
of nature, duty, and oath. I wonder you
demand the Castle without authority from his

and my posterity with the indelible character of

before I deliver up this Castle to such as fight against
his Majesty, and that nothing you can threaten is
formidable to me in respect of the loss of loyalty and
conscience.</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The story of the five months' siege, and how
Pendennis was the last fortress but one (Raglan) to
surrender to the Parliament, are matters of history;
the besieged felt that the eyes of England were
upon them, and did not flinch from the terrible privations
which they were about to suffer. Two other
summonses to surrender were made in the following
month, with the same result as before. But at
length, after many of the horses had been killed 'for
beefe,' the garrison was reduced to the last extremity,
and honourable articles of surrender were at length
agreed to on the 16th August, 1646. Then the brave
little band marched out 'with their Horses, compleat
Arms, and other Equipages, according to their
present or past Commands or Qualities, with flying
Colours, Trumpets sounding, Drums beating,
Matches lighted at both ends, Bullets in their
Mouths,' and so on;&mdash;every man of them, starved
and ragged as they all were, like their veteran leader,
'game to the toes.'<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Clarendon too (book x., par. 73) tells how they 'refused
all summons, nor admitted any treaty till all their
provisions were so near consumed that they had not
victual left for four and twenty hours; and then they
treated, and carried themselves in the treaty with
that resolution and unconcernedness that the enemy
concluded they were in no straits, and so gave them
the conditions they proposed, which were as good as
any garrison in England had accepted. This castle,'
the historian goes on to say, 'was defended by the
Governor thereof, John Arundel, of Trerice, in Cornwall,
an old gentleman of near four score years of
age, and one of the best estates and interest in that
country, who, with the assistance of his son Richard
Arundel (who was then a colonel in the army, and a
stout and diligent officer, and was by the King, after
his return, made a baron,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Lord Arundel of Trerice,
in memory of his father's services, and his own
eminent behaviour throughout the war), maintained
and defended the same to the last extremity.' The
estates of Richard Arundell, which had been confiscated,
were restored to him on his being created a
baron.</p>

<p>A letter from the King, in the possession of Mr.
Rashleigh, of Menabilly (quoted by Captain Oliver),
still further illustrates the high place which the
Arundells held in the esteem of the first Charles.
Writing to Sir William Killigrew, who had solicited
the King that the reversion of the Government of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Pendennis Castle should be promised to the above-mentioned
Richard Arundell, Charles says:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />

<p><span class="smcap">'Will. Killigrew</span>,</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Your suite unto me that I would conferre

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>And accordingly in 1662 Richard Arundell, who was
present at the siege of Pendennis, and whom, by the
way, Clarendon used to address as his 'dear Dick,'
succeeded Sir Peter Killigrew in the governorship of
the Castle, doubtless discharging the office with
ability; but I do not find anything noteworthy during
his tenure of the office, except, perhaps, that when
the oath of supremacy was administered in 1666<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
(after the great fire of London) to Pendennis, as well
as to many other garrisons, one man alone in that
castle, and he, one of Lord Arundell's own servants,
and a Roman Catholic, refused to take it.</p>

<p>Some authorities have stated that Richard Lord
Arundell was succeeded in the governorship by his
son, Lord John; but this is, to say the least, doubtful.</p>

<p>Pity, as it now seems to us, that gallant old John
Arundell did not live long enough to see the King
'enjoy his own again,' and to receive the honours
which, however, as we have seen, were ultimately
conferred upon his son and successor. The capture
of Pendennis and the final loss of the King's cause
nearly ruined old John Arundell also; and it is said
that he was even reduced to crave assistance from
Cromwell himself, urging that the Trerice Arundells
'had once the honour to stand in some friendship, or
even kinship, with your noble family.' The old hero
was buried at Duloe, where, until lately, his monument
might have been seen. Well would he have
deserved a promised barony or any honours that
might have been bestowed upon him, for he and his
family served their King to the utmost of their means,
four of his sons took up arms in the royal cause, and
the two elder were King's men in the House of
Commons. The eldest was killed at the head of his
troop, whilst charging and driving back a sally at
Plymouth in 1643; and Richard, the second son,
the first Baron Arundell of Trerice, probably was at
Edgehill and at Lansdowne, as well as at Pendennis.</p>

<p>The Arundells of Trerice became an extinct family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
by the death of the fourth baron, John, who died in
1768, when the estates passed to William Wentworth,
his wife's nephew, who re-settled them, and they
eventually became the property of their present
possessor, Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, Bart., M.P.</p>

<p>A writer in the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> for 1829
(xcix. pt. 2, p. 215) observed that at that time the
legal representatives of the Lords Arundell of Trerice
were Mr. I. T. P. Bettesworth Trevanion, of Carhayes
in Cornwall, and the Honble. Ada Byron, daughter
of the poet&mdash;'Ada! sole daughter of my house and
heart'&mdash;they being the descendants of the body of
Anne, or Agnes, the only sister of Richard, the first
Baron Arundell, that left issue. Yet it should
perhaps also be recorded how another Arundell,
descended from the Trerice stock, served his country
in a useful, if not in so distinguished a capacity as
did some of his ancestors; for the Honble. Richard
Arundell, an uncle of the last baron, was M.P. for
Knaresborough, was Clerk of the Pipe, Surveyor of
Works, and Master and Warden of the Mint, and a
Commissioner of the Treasury. He married the
Lady Frances Manners, a daughter of the Duke of
Rutland, and died, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine prole</i>, in 1759. Walpole tells
how Lady Arundell, during the earthquake panic
of 1750, was one of those ladies who fled out of
town (to avoid it) some ten miles off, where they
were to play brag till five in the morning, and then
came back to town, 'I suppose' (says Walpole) 'to
look for the bones of their husbands and families
under the rubbish.' 'Earthquake-gowns' were worn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
by ladies during this panic&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, gowns made of
some warm materials in which they could sit up all
night out of doors.</p>

<hr class="r15" />
<h3><em>THE ARUNDELLS OF TOLVERNE.</em></h3>

<p class="noindent">Whilst I write the following lines, there lies
before me an extremely rare, if not unique, MS.
chart of Falmouth Haven and its tributary waters.
It was made by one Baptista Boazio in 1597,
and on it is marked, 'Tolverne Place, Mr.
John Arondell.' The chart is of peculiar interest,
inasmuch as, in addition to the ordinary information
contained in documents of this nature, it gives the
names of the occupants of the principal houses
at the time. Thus we find a 'Buscowen' at
Tregothnan (then called Buscowen House), a
'Carminow' at Vintangollan, a 'Bonithon' at
Cariklew (Carclew), a 'Trefusis' at Trefusis, and so
on. King Harry's (or rather Henry's) Passage (so
named on the chart) and the Tolverne Ferry are
also shown on this map; far more important
passages of course in those days, when one of the
main thoroughfares from the eastern to the western
parts of Cornwall, through Tregony, Ruan-lani-horne
and Philleigh, crossed the Fal at this point.</p>

<p>Tolverne is shown on the map as a place of some
importance, as it doubtless was in those days; for
here (if anywhere in Cornwall) Henry VIII. had,
more than fifty years before the date of the map,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
probably stayed on his visit of inspection to the
two castles of Pendennis and St. Mawes at the
mouth of the haven, hard by, which that monarch
(as Leland's inscriptions on the masonry record) was
deeply interested in making secure against a foreign
enemy.</p>

<p>Tolverne is now merely a substantial farmhouse.
We are indebted to Carew for the following picture
of the place, contemporary with the map, as it
stood in his time nearly three hundred years ago:
'Amongst all of the houses upon that side the river,
<em>Talverne</em>, for pleasant prospect, large scope, and
other housekeeping commodities, challengeth the
pre-eminence. It was given to a younger brother of
Lanhearne, for some six or seven descents past, and
hath bred gentlemen of good worth and calling;
amongst whom I may not forget the late kind and
valiant Sir John Arundell, who matched with Godolphin,
nor John, his vertuous and hopeful succeeding
son, who married with Carew.' It will be remembered
also that Richard Carew himself married an
Arundell.</p>

<p>Philleigh was their church, as Mawgan was that
of the Lanherne Arundells, and Newlyn East that
of the Arundells of Trerice; and the transept of
Philleigh is still called the Tolverne or Falmouth
Aisle; but no traces of Arundell monuments are
now to be found there;&mdash;although C. S. Gilbert, in
his history of Cornwall, states that in one of the
windows there was a shield bearing the arms of
the family. Yet, so early as 1383, the connexion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of the family with Church affairs in the parish is
shown by the fact that, in that year, Ralph Soor,
or Le Sore, obtained a license from the Bishop of
Exeter for saying mass in his chapel in his
manor-house of Tolferne; and that a Sir John
Arundell of Trembleth<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> married Joane le Soore of
Tolverne, in the reign of Edward I., two or three
generations before this.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The Arundells do not, however, seem to have
regularly established themselves at Tolverne until a
son of Sir John of Lanherne and his wife Annora
Lambourne&mdash;Sir Thomas Arundell of Tolverne&mdash;settled
here with his wife, Margery Lerchdekne.
They had no children, and, on the lady's death, Sir
Thomas took unto himself a second wife, Elizabeth
Paulton, from whom the Tolverne Arundells may be
said to have descended. Sir Thomas himself died
in 1443; but I do not know where he was buried;
probably at Philleigh.</p>

<p>Of the lives of the Tolverne Arundells, whose
current seems to have been as tranquil as that of
the sylvan Fal, which ebbed and flowed round their
domain, I find little to record, except that they
intermarried with many of the old Cornish families&mdash;with
the Courtneys of Boconnoc, with Reskymer,
Trelawny, Carminow, St. Aubyn, their neighbour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>Trefusis, Chamond, Godolphin, and, as we have
seen, Carew. We have traces of the will of <em>Thomas
Arundell, Esq.</em>, of Talverne, dated 22nd May, 1552,
which shows that he possessed tenements in Truro
borough and elsewhere, also the passage and passage-boat
of Talverne. The inventory of his property
was sworn at £224 5s. 9d. There is also extant
the will of John Arundell, 7th February, 1598, but
it contains little of interest, except that he bequeaths
to his mother his 'little guilt sack-cup with a cover,'
and that his executors were Richard Carew of
Antony, and Richard Trevanion of St. Gerrans.</p>

<p>One of the sons of the latter Arundell, namely
Thomas, who was knighted by James I., sold Tolverne;
having seriously impaired his fortune, it is
said, by endeavouring to discover an imaginary island
in America, called 'Old Brazil;' he afterwards lived
at Truthall in the parish of Sithney. One of the
Truthall Arundells, John, was Colonel of Horse
for Charles II., and a Deputy-Governor of Pendennis
Castle under his relative Richard, Lord Arundell of
Trerice. He was buried at Sithney on 25th May,
1671; but I have hitherto been unable to trace anything
further of interest of his history, or of that of
his descendants. One of the latest members of this
branch married William Jago, of Wendron, whose
children took the name and arms of Arundell in
1815; and it may be added that Hals the historian
descended from the Arundells by the female line.</p>

<hr class="r15" />
<h3><em>THE MINOR ARUNDELLS.</em></h3>

<p class="noindent">The story of the Arundells of Cornwall is nearly
told. There were, as I intimated at the commencement
of this chapter, some minor branches,
who perhaps deserve a passing notice: the most
noteworthy of whom appears to be the branch
that settled at the manor<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and barton of Menadarva
(== the hill by the water), in the parish of Illogan,
near the sea-coast, and about three miles north-west
of Camborne. This branch seems to have been
founded by Robert, a natural son of that Sir John
Arundell of Trerice, Vice-Admiral of Cornwall,
'Jack of Tilbury,' who died in the third year of
Elizabeth's reign. Robert took to wife Elizabeth
Clapton, and they had numerous descendants.</p>

<p>I must once more be indebted to Hals, for the
following bit of gossip about the Arundells of Menadarva:
'The last gentleman of this family dying
without issue male, his sisters married to Tresahar
and others, became for a time, possessed of this lordship;
but it happened that a brother of theirs also,
who was a merchant-factor in Spain, who married
an innkeeper's widow there, in Malaga or Seville,
of English extraction, was said to be dead without
issue; but it seems, before his death, had issue by
her an infant son, who was bred up in Spain till
he came of age, without knowledge of his relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
aforesaid; who being brought into England with
his mother, temp. William III., delivered ejectments
upon the barton and manor of Menadarva and the
occupants thereof, as heir-at-law to Arundell, and
brought down a trial upon the same at Lanceston,
in this county, where, upon the issue, it appeared,
upon the oaths of Mr. Delliff, and other Spanish
merchants of London, that the said heir was the
legitimate son of Mr. Arundell, aforesaid, of Spain,
and born under coverture or marriage. He obtained
a verdict and judgment thereon for the same, and is
now in possession thereof. He married Tremanheer
of Penzance, and hath issue. The arms of this
family are the same as those of the Arundells of
Trerice, with due distinction.'</p>

<p>An offshoot, as I take him to be, of the Menadarva
Arundells, one Francis, who was born about the
year 1620, is said to have settled at Trengwainton,
near Penzance, where they lived for some generations;
and one of them, Francis Arundell, served with some
distinction on the side of the Parliament during
the Civil War, ranking as captain. I fancy it must be
his son who mourned in Latin verse, after the
fashion of the time, the deaths of two Queens of
England, while, as a Commoner of Trinity College,
Cambridge, he was under the tuition of Isaac
Barrow.</p>

<p>Yet another minor branch of the Arundells remains
to be noticed, viz. a younger branch of the Arundells
of Lanherne, descended from that Sir John Arundell
who married Elizabeth Danet, of Danet's Hall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
They had their seat at Trevithick, some two miles
west of the town of St. Columb Major, and not much
farther from Lanherne itself. The representative
of the family who was alive at the time of the
Herald's Visitation in 1620, was named Thomas, who
married Rachel, the daughter of Sir Giles Montpesson,
Knight, and who, Hals tell us, died 'without
issue, but not without wasting a great part of his
estate.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now, to adopt a metaphor of Sir Humphry
Davy's, at length the great stream of the Arundells
of Cornwall, like some mighty river losing itself
among the sands as it approaches the ocean shore,
becomes so divided that we can no longer easily
trace its course. After the names and dates to
which we have been referring, no Arundell of distinction
seems to have arisen in Cornwall; and their
places soon 'knew them no more.' They became
scattered throughout the county,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and by the help of
the Bishop of Exeter's transcripts, and the Parish
Registers of Camborne, St. Erme, St. Ewe, Falmouth,
Fowey, Gulval, Mawnan, Menheniot, Mevagissey,
Sheviock, and Sithney, we find that down to the year
1725 there were still indeed Arundells in Cornwall
being christened, dying, marrying,&mdash;but no longer
'great Arundells' as of yore: in fact, the entry
in the year 1725, in the St. Erme Register, merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
records the baptism of Charles, the son of Richard
Arundell, 'a day labourer.'</p>

<p>Yet, by a strange freak of fortune, not only did the
female line continue, but one of the Arundells&mdash;William
by name&mdash;married nearly two and a quarter
centuries ago, Dorothy, a daughter of that Theodore
Palæologus<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> who was buried in Landulph
Church in 1636. She is described in the Parish
Register as being 'ex stirpe Imperatorum.' So that
there probably flows in the veins of many a rustic of
the neighbourhood of Callington and Saltash the
mingled blood of those Arundells who came over to
England with the Conqueror, and that of the Byzantine
Emperors of the East.</p>

then to the Coleshills, one of whom married Sir Renfry Arundell. On
the death of Sir Renfry's grandson, Sir Edmund Arundell, the
Arundells sold it, in 1711, to Sir John Anstis, Garter King of Arms.
The Arundells seem, however, to have long kept up their connection
with Tremodret, as we find from the pages of gossip-loving Hals, who
tells us how 'One Forbes, or Forbhas, was presented rector of this
parish in the latter end of Cromwell's usurpation, and lived here on this
fat benefice, without spending or lending any money, many years,
always pretending want thereof; at length he died suddenly intestate,
about the year 1681, having neither wife nor legitimate child, nor any
relation of his blood in this kingdom; upon news of whose death Mr.
Arundell, his patron, opened his trunks, and found about £3,000 in
gold and silver, and carried it thence to his own house. The fame and
envy of which fact flew suddenly abroad, so that Mr. Buller, of Morval,
had notice thereof, who claimed a part or share in this treasure upon
pretence of a nuncupative will, wherein Forbes, some days before his
death, had made him his executor, and the same was concerted into
writing, whereupon he demanded the £3,000 of Mr. Arundell. But he
refusing to deliver the same, Mr. Buller filed a bill in Chancery against
him, the said Mr. Arundell, praying relief in the premise, and that the
said money might be brought or deposited in the said Court, which at
length was accordingly done; where, after long discussing this matter
between the lawyers and clerks in that Court, in fine, as I was informed,
the Court, the plaintiff, and the defendant shared the money amongst
them, without the least thanks to or remembrance of the deceased
wretch, Forbes, for the same; abundantly verifying that saying in the
Sacred Writings, "Man layeth up riches, but knows not who shall
gather them."'</p></div>

(Michell), at least as early as the time of Edward I. Indeed, Browne
Willis, in his 'Notitia Parliamentaria,' observes: 'The Manor of
Michell (not Michael) is still (1726) in possession of the ancient family

 who examines the one-inch
ordnance map of that part of Cornwall
which lies between Redruth and Camborne,
cannot fail to be struck with the
strange lines and markings that appear upon it.
Long-dotted lines, and straight markings, showing
the directions of the metallic lodes, of the 'faults,'
and the 'cross-courses;' and arrow-heads, indicating
the ever-varying dip of the strata, intermingled with
those cabalistic symbols which are usually employed
to denote the planets, (but in this case to explain the
metals for which the innumerable mines are worked),
crowd the surface of the map to such an extent as to
make it almost illegible. These markings indicate
the existence, in abundance, in this part of the county
of that mineral wealth for which Cornwall has so long
been famous, and which, until lately, has contributed
no less to the general welfare of her inhabitants than
to the enrichment of some of her more illustrious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
families&mdash;in a remarkable degree to that whose story
we are about to consider. Nor should we omit to
notice here that the lords of the soil&mdash;notably the
houses of Basset and Pendarves&mdash;have in their turn
striven to ameliorate the condition of the miner by
their endeavouring, by the use of machinery and
by many other means to lessen his arduous and
perilous labour, and to promote his social, domestic,
and moral welfare. We shall also see that the
Bassets have been no less distinguished in old times
for their attachment to the Crown&mdash;an attachment
which at one period cost them the loss of nearly all
their estates&mdash;and that they have therefore fully
justified the adoption of their family motto, which I
have used as the motto for this chapter.</p>

<p>The actual surface of the ground between
Camborne and Redruth, in the district referred
to above, is even more disfigured than the appearance
of the map suggests. The earth seems
to have been turned inside out: grass is scarcely
anywhere to be seen, but instead of it vast heaps of
'attle,' or refuse, from the subterranean excavations;
the streams are discoloured by the red mine-rubbish,
and look like rivers of blood; whilst the air is filled
with discordant shrieks of the ill-greased, out-of-door
machinery, and the booming thuds of steam pumping-engines.
But, close to the northern confines of this
scene of haggard ugliness, and between it and the
Bristol Channel, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text 'their lies'">there lies</ins> a fair large park of a
thousand acres, beautifully timbered, and evidencing
the care and attention which have been bestowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
upon it for centuries by the ancient family<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> who
have so long been its owners&mdash;the Bassets of Tehidy.</p>

<p>That they were not originally of Cornish extraction
their name sufficiently proclaims. Like the
Grenvilles and the St. Aubyns, they 'came over
with the Conqueror;' as likewise did the De
Dunstanvilles, who were also seated here at a very
early date.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>According to Lysons (who during the present century
enjoyed peculiar advantages for learning the
story of the family, from being the personal friend
of Sir Francis Basset, Lord de Dunstanville), the
Bassets of Cornwall and Devon&mdash;for the members
of this family seem to have very early settled not
only in the two westernmost counties, but also in
other parts of England&mdash;are descended from Osmund
Basset, a younger son of Sir Ralph Basset, the
Justiciary of King Henry I.</p>

<p>I am aware that Hals says that one of the family
held a military post in this part of Cornwall, under
Robert, Earl of Morton; and that another writer
(in Lake's 'Parochial History of Cornwall') states
that they are descended from one Thurstan Basset,
who held six hides of land in Drayton, Staffordshire,
and who was probably a son of that Osmund Basset
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>who came over from his native France with William
I.:&mdash;we shall, however, probably be safer in following
Lysons.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>The earliest mention of the <em>name</em> that I have been
able to discover is that of Osmund Basset&mdash;probably
the before named Norman Knight&mdash;who was a witness
in 1050 to an agreement respecting the Abbey
of St. Ebrulf, at Utica.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But, to come to the connection of the Bassets
with <em>Tehidy</em>, or rather in the first place to its possession
by the De Dunstanvilles: it seems that Alan,
of the latter patronymic, was lord of the manor of
Tehidy in the year 1100; and here seems to be a
fitting place to mention the nature of the connexion
between the two names which appears in the titles
of the Sir Francis Basset mentioned above. It
arose thus: Thomas Basset, a descendant&mdash;probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
a great grandson&mdash;of King Henry I.'s Justiciary,
and himself holding a like post in the days of Henry
III., married one Alice de Dunstanville,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and most
of their descendants seem to have settled mainly in
Oxfordshire and the midland counties.</p>

<p>There was, however, according to Lysons, another
Basset named William, of Ipsden, also an Oxfordshire
man, who, in the days of Richard I.&mdash;probably
about the close of his reign&mdash;married Cecilia,
the daughter of Alan de Dunstanville, and had with
her 'Menalida' in Cornwall, which property, Playfair
says, 'her father acquired by marriage with a
daughter of Reginald Fitz-Henry;' Menalida&mdash;so
our author thinks&mdash;being an ancient name of
Tehidy.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The marriage of this William Basset with Cecilia de
Dunstanville probably began, or at least confirmed,
the connexion which still subsists between the
Bassets and Tehidy. Here they settled; and, as
the centuries rolled on, their blood has intermingled
with the old Cornish stocks by marriages with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>families of Rashleigh, Carveth, Godolphin, Prideaux,
Courtenay, Grenville, Trenouth, Trengove, Trelawny
of Trelawny, Marrys of Marrys (near Bude), and
Enys of Enys. And their bones lie in Cornish soil;
for the most part in the adjacent parish church
of Illogan.</p>

<p>Amongst other early fragmentary notices of them
that I have found, are the following:</p>

<p>In the list of knights summoned from Cornwall,
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1277, to attend King Edward I. at Worcester,
on service against Llewellyn ap Griffith, the name of
Ralph Basset occurs.</p>

<p>In 1324, William Basset's name occurs amongst
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">'nomina hominum ad Arma in com. Cornubiæ.'</span>
In the reign of Edward III., he obtained a patent
from that King for two markets weekly, and two
fairs every year for Redruth. There was another
William Basset who held a military feu at Tehidy
and Trevalga, in 3rd Henry IV.</p>

<p>They were Sheriffs of the County during the
reigns of three Henries&mdash;the 6th, the 7th, and the
8th; and also in some subsequent reigns: and one
of the family<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> occupied, in the reign of Edward IV.,
that Castle of Carnbrea which stands on the granite
hill of that name, within the manor of Tehidy,
commanding a view of both the English and St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
George's Channels, and down whose slopes groves of
old oaks in those days flourished all the way from
the summit of the hill to Portreath, or Basset's Cove.
Most of these were cut down in the time of the
Civil Wars&mdash;probably in order to raise money for
the King&mdash;the remainder (if Hals is to be trusted)
by the old Lady Basset, 'who had the estate in
jointure.' Well might Leland say that theirs was
'a right goodly lordship,' extending as it did over
large portions of the three parishes of Illogan, Redruth,
and Camborne, the advowsons of which belong
to the manor of Tehidy. In illustration of
the latter statement, and further, as showing the early
connexion of the Bassets with this neighbourhood,
a writer in Lake's 'Parochial History of Cornwall'
says, that '11 March, 1277, Sir Lawrence Basset,
Knight, presented one Michael to the Church of St.
Euinus, Redruth; and William Basset, Knight,
presented Thomas Cotteford to Illogan in 1382;
Alexander Trembras by J. Basset, of Tehidy, 1435,'&mdash;and
so on. Sometimes a member of the Basset
family held one or other of the three livings.</p>

<p>Of the early members of the family I know of little
further that seems worthy of record; but perhaps
we should not pass altogether unnoticed, the fact that
the William Basset who obtained the patent for the
Redruth markets, obtained a license to embattle his
manor-house of Tehidy, in the year 1330-31 (Rot.
Pat. 4th Edward III., Memb. 10); and that at
this time the Bassets also had seats at Umberleigh,
White Chappel, and Heanton Court, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Devon. This William appears to be he who was
Knight of the Shire for Cornwall, 6th Edward II.,
and again in 6th and 8th Edward III.; a position
which probably assisted in procuring for him the
above-mentioned permission to fortify his house.</p>

<p>No representation of the original house at Tehidy,
so far as I know, exists. We may be quite sure that
it was a very different structure from that which now
occupies its place, and which was built for John
Pendarves Basset<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> by Thomas Edwards, about the
year 1734. Dr. Borlase figures it in his 'Natural
History.' Edwards was a London architect, and,
as I was informed by the late Mr. Thomas Ferris
of Rosewyn, Truro, was employed in the erection of
some of the best modern Cornish mansions&mdash;as
Nanswhydden, destroyed by fire early in this century;
and the handsome house of Mr. William Lemon, in
Prince's Street, Truro. Mr. Edwards was also the
architect of the steeple and west front of St. Mary's
Church, Truro, recently removed to give place to
the new cathedral. The present mansion of Tehidy
has been much enlarged, and contains some excellent
pictures by Vandyck, Lely, Kneller, Rubens,
and Reynolds; and the Print-Room of the British
Museum contains interesting engravings of portraits
of some members of the family.</p>

<p>Not even any remains exist of the ancient structure;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
yet portions at least must have been standing
in comparatively modern times; for Leland speaks
of a castelet or pile (of Basset's), and a park wall,
both of which Tonkin says were to be seen in <em>his</em>
time: and he died about the year 1750.</p>

<p>For more than a century after the date of the
Basset who fortified Tehidy, the family appears to
have made little mark in history, unless we may
mention one John Basset (then Sheriff, as so many
of his race were before and after him) whose <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">posse
comitatus</i> was so weak that he dared not encounter the
Cornish insurgents at the Flammock (or Flamank)
rebellion; and thus allowed the rebels, whose object
was to depose King Henry VII., on account of his
exactions for the expenses of the Scotch war, to march
on to Bodmin and Launceston; and so into Devon.
But, despite their daring, the bills and bows of the
Cornish, though their arrows were (says Lord Bacon)
'the length of a tailor's yard&mdash;so strong and mighty
a bow were they said to draw'&mdash;were no match for
the King's artillery, which completed their defeat at
Blackheath, in 1496.</p>

<p>About the middle of the sixteenth century, the family
appears to have divided into two branches. The
Devonshire branch, descended from John, the elder
son of John Basset of Umberleigh and his wife
Honora Grenville, became extinct in 1796, by the
death of Francis Basset; the Cornish branch was
continued by George, the younger son of the above
Sir John and the Lady Honora. Of this George
there is little further to say, except that his wife bore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the odd name of Jaquet Coffin, and that he himself
was member of Parliament for Launceston, in which
neighbourhood the Bassets formerly held a considerable
amount of land, which they disposed of a few
years ago. The children of George and Jaquet do
not seem to have distinguished themselves: the two
girls married, respectively, a Cary and a Newman;
the son and heir, who has a brass at Illogan recording
that he died in 1603, aged 43, married Jane, a
daughter of Sir Francis Godolphin.</p>

<p>Possibly the intermixture of the blood of the more
warlike Godolphins may have contributed to the
result, but this at least is certain&mdash;that their eldest
son Francis, whom we shall have to notice more
fully, was one of the most distinguished members of
the family.</p>

<p>The Bassets, like most of the Cornish gentry, as
we shall see, were, with perhaps one exception, of
whom more hereafter, stout Royalists; and at the
outbreak of the Civil War, Francis, then head of the
family, was Sheriff and Vice-Admiral of Cornwall (a
command subsequently divided into two&mdash;north and
south)&mdash;and Governor of St. Michael's Mount,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> which
was his own inheritance. He was 'a staunch friend
to Church and King; and&mdash;a devoted lover of
game-cocks,' says a writer who was not much disposed
to magnify Francis Basset's good points. I
hardly know whether or not it is worth recording, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
showing the Vice-Admiral's love of sport; but Hals
tells the story how he 'let fly his goshawk or tassel
to a heath-polt, or heath-cock,' and both were lost to
sight; but were both sent back to Tehidy the next
day by the Mayor of Camelford, the heath-cock
killed by the hawk, but the latter alive and well. By
a comparison of time it was shown that in half an
hour the birds had flown thirty-two miles. Sir
Francis was, moreover, Recorder of St. Ives, represented
that borough in Parliament, procured its
first Charter, and presented the burgesses with a
loving-cup, bearing this genial, though uncouth, inscription:</p>

<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'If any discord 'twixt my friends arise<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Within the borough of belov'd St. Ives,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">It is desirèd this my cup of loue<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To euerie one a peace-maker may proue.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then am I blest to have giuen a legacie,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">So like my harte, unto posterite.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right small"><span class="smcap">Francis Basset</span>, A<sup>o</sup>. 1640.
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p class="noindent">In 1640 he also contested the Cornish borough of
Michael, or Michell, for which, however, he did not
sit, owing to a double return.</p>

<p>Francis Basset took to wife Ann, daughter of Sir
Jonathan Trelawny. They were married at Pelynt
in 1620; and, that time had not dulled their affection,
the two following letters, written nearly a quarter of
a century after the wedding-day, will show.</p>

<p>But it should be premised, that whilst Sir Bevil
Grenville, aided by Major-General Thomas Basset,
was defeating the forces of the Parliament at Stamford
Hill, near Stratton in North Cornwall, Francis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Basset in the West was busily engaged in raising
money for the King, and in bringing together and
drilling what forces he could in his own part of the
county. It was also his function, in co-operation
with Lord Goring, to intercept the supplies furnished
from West Cornwall to the Earl of Essex, and thus
to precipitate the engagements which ended so disastrously
for the cause of the Parliamentary troops
in the West of England.</p>

<p>The good news from Stamford Hill seems to have
reached the Sheriff at Truro, whereupon he writes,
with an overflowing heart, this letter:</p>

<p class="center"><cite>Francis Basset to his Wife, after the News of the Victory
of Stratton.</cite></p>

<p class="p1-5" />

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The foregoing letter appears to me to be interesting,
not only as showing the loving terms on which the
wife and husband were, but also as indicating the
tension of feeling which existed in Cornwall at this
critical period in Charles's affairs. We may be sure
that Francis Basset and his men pushed forward
rapidly on the receipt of this good news, and that he
determined not to lose the chance of being present
at the next engagement when the banners of King
and Parliament were again to float in defiance
against each other. Accordingly we find him on the
field of Braddock soon after,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and again, after the
fight, chronicling another victory in the following
impassioned terms to his wife. Notice that he was
now knighted, and the change of style in which he
addresses 'my lady' at '<em>her</em> Tehidy:'</p>

<p class="p1-5">'To my lady Basset, at her Tehidy, joyfull.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>But Sir Francis, though he did not live to see the
days of the Commonwealth (for he died 19th September,
1645), lived long enough to see the reverse
of such joyful pictures as the foregoing.</p>

<p>Upon his son and heir, John, fell the full
vengeance of Cromwell's government. He was imprisoned
for his father's 'delinquency'&mdash;though he
had never himself been in arms&mdash;was compelled to
compound for his estates, and, saddest blow of all,
in 1660 to sell St. Michael's Mount, which from that
date has been held continuously by the family of
St. Aubyn. Other hardships too he suffered, which,
the county historians tell us, reduced his estate and
the family very low. Up to this date the Bassets had
undoubtedly vindicated their claim to the first half of
the family motto&mdash;'Pro Rege.'</p>

<p>But three good matches brought more money into
the impoverished Tehidy coffers; and great profits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
from tin again restored the Bassets to wealth and
prosperity.</p>

<p>The Vice-Admiral had a second son&mdash;Francis&mdash;also
a Colonel in the army. But in later life he
became a Baptist, and resided at Taunton; one of
that class who, imbued with stern and self-denying
views of religion, caused Erasmus to ejaculate, 'O,
sit anima mea cum Puritanis Anglicanis.'</p>

<p>The Colonel was accused in 1661 of a conspiracy
against Charles II., and there is a Star Chamber
complaint to this effect; but ultimately the letter
pretending to have been written by Francis Basset
was demonstrated to be a forgery. Indeed the whole
family seems to have been so thoroughly attached to
the Stuarts, that, on the accession of the house of
Hanover in 1714, one is not very much surprised to
find that Mr. Basset of Tehidy would have been
arrested by Mr. Boscawen (then Sheriff of Cornwall)
as a Jacobite, had not Mr. Basset made a timely
flight from his house. Unless I am mistaken, this
was the same Francis Basset who was himself Sheriff
of Cornwall in 1708.</p>

<p>The connexion between the families of Basset
and Pendarves is amusingly illustrated by the record
of a marriage which took place at St. Stephen's in
Branwell, on 12th April, 1737, the scribe who entered
the event in the Parish Register describing the
bridegroom as 'a Squar,' that being the nearest
approach which the parish clerk's acquaintance with
orthography enabled him to make towards writing
the happy man down an Esquire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>We now come to what I cannot help considering
a very interesting period in the family history&mdash;interesting
not so much from the importance of the
incidents chronicled (though they give us a curious
peep into the interior of a Cornish gentleman's household
early in the last century), as from their having
been recorded by the pen of the beautiful and accomplished
Mary Grenville, a descendant of the old
Cornish family of Stow, better known to us nowadays
as the Mrs. Delany to whom Ballard dedicated his
'Celebrated British Ladies,' and whose autobiography,
edited by one of her descendants, Lady Llanover,
is, notwithstanding its portentous length, one of the
most entertaining books of modern times.</p>

<p>When only sixteen or seventeen years of age,
Mary Grenville married her first husband, Alexander
Pendarves, of Roscrow near Penryn, he being then
sixty years old. She describes with much vivacity
her first acquaintance with her Cornish home, and
her grumpy old husband whom she styles in her
diary 'Gromio.' The old man had quarrelled with
Francis Basset for marrying, as his second wife,
Gromio's niece, Mary, daughter and heiress of his
younger brother, the Rev. John Pendarves of
Drewsteignton, and for refusing his offer to settle
upon Francis Basset his whole estate if he would
take the name of Pendarves after his, Alexander's,
death. This, Basset, justly proud of his own
family name, declined to do; and hence no doubt
the reason of Alexander's marriage with the young
Mary Grenville. Their marriage life lasted only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
about seven years, and was not a particularly
happy one. Soon after her husband's death Mrs.
Pendarves married Dr. Delany, Dean of Down,
to whom she seems to have been fondly attached;
though he too was much her senior.</p>

<p>To this charming and talented lady we are indebted
for the following glance at the interior of
Tehidy nearly 150 years ago, and for a portrait of
the Basset of the period&mdash;Francis, grandfather of
the first Lord de Dunstanville:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'About a month after we had been at home (<em>i.e.</em>,
at Roscrow), and had received the compliments of the
chief of our neighbourhood, Gromio proposed that
we should make a visit to Bassanio (Mr. F. Basset),
who had married his niece. I made no objection,
but was rather pleased to leave my own house for
some time. Bassanio had been in his youth a man
of gallantry; his figure despicable enough, but his
wit and cheerfulness made amends, though at this
time both were a good deal impaired by an ill state
of health and a very dull wife, who, with a very
inferior understanding to his, was the chief agent.
He seemed only to act with her permission, which
was most astonishing. We were received at first, I
thought, very coolly. Gromio's marrying was a great
disappointment to Bassanio and Fulvia (Mrs. Basset).
They expected his estate, and were both avaricious.
Bassanio liked to take wine, but not to excess.
When his spirits were a little raised, he was very gay
and entertaining; and till then I had not laughed, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
shown the least sign of mirth. After having spent a
fortnight at this place, Gromio grew thoughtful, and
would often retire to his chamber, and at supper and
dinner sat gloomy and discontented. When I was
alone with him, he would sigh and groan as if his
heart would break. I thought him ill, and asked him
several times if he was not, to which he always
answered with great sullenness "he was well enough."
I began then to examine my own behaviour to him;
I was sure he could resent nothing in that more than
he had reason for before, and that I was not so grave,
but (in appearance) happier than at first. After
enduring great anxiety of mind for a week, I could
not forbear taking notice to him of the change I
found in his temper; for though he never made himself
agreeable to me, it had not been for want of
kindness and civility in his behaviour; but now he
had laid aside both, and I own I was greatly perplexed
to find out the cause. 'Tis certain that fondness
from a person distasteful to one is tormenting, and
what can so much hurt a generous heart that can
make no return for it? On the other hand, it is very
disagreeable to be treated with gloomy looks which
show an inward discontent, and not to be able to
account for it.</p>

<p>'At last the mighty distress broke out in these
words: "Oh, Aspasia!"' (Mrs. Delany's assumed
name), '"take care of Bassanio; he is a cunning,
treacherous man, and has been the ruin of one woman
already, who was wife to his bosom friend!" and
then he burst into tears. I was so struck with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
this caution, and his behaviour, that I could not
for some time speak; at last I said, "I am
miserable indeed, if you can be jealous of this
ugly man. What am I for the future to expect?"
I was so much surprised and vexed, that it threw me
into an agony of tears. He assured me all the time
that he had nothing to charge me with; that my
behaviour was just what he wished it to be, but he
could not help seeing how much Bassanio was
charmed with everything I said or did, and he knew
him to be a man not to be trusted. By this time I
was a little recovered, and entreated him to return
to Averno (Roscrow); but he said, "No; to convince
me he had no doubt of my conduct, he would
not go before the time he had first proposed."'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>And so it seems the party did not break up for a
week or ten days; Gromio grumbling; Bassanio
vainly trying to make himself extremely agreeable
during their walks and drives in that 'very romantic
part of the country,' as Mrs. Delany well calls it;
Fulvia as dull as ever; and Aspasia untouched by
the flattery and gallantries of her would-be lover.
At length she had to write 'that Bassanio was too
quick-sighted not to perceive Gromio's suspicions
and my great dislike of his behaviour; and, as it was
his interest to keep in favour with his uncle, he was
upon his guard, and never gave either of us reason
to be offended with him any more. Soon after (in
1721) he was seized with terrible fits, that ended his
life a year and half after I married.'<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>There is yet another entry in Mrs. Delany's diary
which refers to the Tehidy family. In June, 1756,
she writes: 'I am going into mourning for my
great-great-nephew Basset, who died last week. I
pity his unhappy mother extremely. She has gone
through much care and anxiety on his account.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>John Basset, the son of the Rev. John Basset,
rector of Illogan and Camborne, now claims a
passing notice before we come to the last and
perhaps most illustrious member of this family.
He was born on 17th November, 1791, and was
elected member of Parliament for Helston in 1840,
failing, however, to retain his seat at the election in
the following year; but he chiefly distinguished himself
by the zealous interest which he took in the
welfare of Cornish mining and the Cornish miner.
In 1836 he published some treatises on the 'Mining
Courts of the Duchy of Cornwall,' and, in the same
year, 'Thoughts on the' (then) 'New Stannary Bill.'
Three years afterwards appeared the 'Origin and
History of the Bounding Act;' and, after another
similar interval, in 1842&mdash;the year before his death
at Boppart, on the Rhine&mdash;his 'Observations on
Cornish Mining.'</p>

<p>But perhaps his most valuable contribution to
Cornish literature was a treatise published in 1840,
having for its humane object the amelioration of the
physical condition of the miner&mdash;viz., 'Observations
on the Machinery used for Raising Miners in the
Hartz.' There can be little doubt that this work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
tended in no small degree to direct public attention
to the great and avoidable exhaustion caused to the
miner by his having to ascend many fathoms of
ladders after long and laborious work in the heated
and vitiated atmosphere of many of our deep mines.
The result was the invention of an ingenious machine
known as the steam man-engine, by means of which
two huge vertical poles, with foot-rests at intervals,
are set in motion side by side the whole depth of the
mine-shaft. As one pole ascends, the other descends,
and thus, by changing from one to the other by help
of the foot-rests, the miner is enabled to ascend from
his work, or descend to it, with the minimum expenditure
of his own strength. If he who makes
an oak grow where none grew before is to be considered
a benefactor to his race, surely anyone who
contributes in greater or less degree to so benevolent
and beneficial an object as this steam man-engine has
proved to be, has a good claim to be ranked among
the philanthropic benefactors of his race. There is, of
course, some little risk in performing this feat in the
dark, damp and slippery mine-shafts, lit, perhaps, by a
solitary candle stuck into a lump of clay and attached
to the front of the miner's hat; and it is scarcely
necessary to add that the use of the man-engine is
most strictly forbidden to all except those by whom
it is really required. Is it necessary to say that the
man-engine, therefore, became a great attraction to
all schoolboys who chanced to be within easy distance
of one?&mdash;at any rate the writer, then a schoolboy,
used to spend parts of many a half-holiday in practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
investigating the merits of the machine, by
descending by its means into the depths of the
earth, until the utter darkness made the descent too
dangerous even for a schoolboy.</p>

<p>John Basset's eldest son, John Francis Basset, of
Stratton, brother of the present owner of the estates
(Gustavus Lambert Basset, who served in the Crimea
as lieutenant in the 72nd Highlanders), was a barrister,
and was Sheriff of Cornwall in 1861. He succeeded
to the Tehidy property on the death of his
aunt, Frances, Baroness Basset, in 1855, and died at
the family mansion in 1869. His chief mining interests
(which were immense) were in the Bassets,
South Frances, and Dolcoath mines. His landed
property lay chiefly in Illogan, Camborne, Redruth,
and St. Agnes, besides other estates which he owned
in Meneage, Gluvias, Falmouth, Tywardreath, etc.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But we must now speak of one whom Davies
Gilbert, P.R.S., described as, in every sense, the
first man in the county&mdash;I mean that Francis
Basset, D.C.L., Baron de Dunstanville of Tehidy,
and Baron Basset of Stratton,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> whose monument
forms so conspicuous an object on the summit of the
historic hill of Carn Brea, and which was erected to
his memory by the county of Cornwall in 1836.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
He was the grandson of Mrs. Delany's Francis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>Basset, and son of the Francis Basset who represented
Penryn in Parliament from 1766 to 1769.
His mother was Margaret St. Aubyn.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Born at
Walcot, in Oxfordshire, on 9th August, 1757, he was
educated at Harrow, Eton, and lastly at King's College,
Cambridge, where he took his degree of M.A.
when twenty-nine years of age. When Lord de
Dunstanville's father died, the boy wrote to Dr.
Bathurst&mdash;afterwards Bishop of Norwich&mdash;this
characteristic little note:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Knowing the regard my papa had for you, I
wish you would be my tutor.</p>

<p class="center">'Yours,</p>
<p class="right">'<span class="smcap">Frank Basset</span>.' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>A tour on the Continent in company with the
Rev. William Sandys, the son of a former steward
of the family, a gentleman who had been specially
trained to perform the pleasant but arduous duties
of cicerone, completed his education, and thus he
started in life with every advantage that a youth of
talents and position could desire; nor did he fail to
employ them.</p>

<p>On his return home he at once threw himself into
the arena of public life; and from time to time
published sundry political and agricultural treatises.
Amongst the former may be mentioned, 'Thoughts
on Equal Representation' (1783), 'Observations on
a Treaty of Commerce between England and France'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
(1787), 'The Theory and Practice of the French
Constitution' (1794), 'The Crimes of Democracy'
(1798), and a speech which he delivered at a county
meeting at Bodmin in 1809.</p>

<p>That he considered the foregoing productions not
unworthy of his genius may be judged from the fact
that he had them handsomely bound together, and
presented them to his 'dearest friend, Miss (Harriet)
Lemon,' the daughter of Sir William Lemon, of
Carclew, Bart., M.P., a lady who ultimately became
his second wife: the volume is preserved in the
Royal Institution of Cornwall. His agricultural
tracts&mdash;'Experiments in Agriculture' (1794), 'A Fat
Ox' (1799), 'Crops and Prices' (1800), 'Crops in
Cornwall' (1801), 'Mildew' (1805)&mdash;mostly appeared
in Young's 'Annals of Agriculture;' and, like his
political treatises, evince much acumen and practical
common sense.</p>

<p>He was chosen Recorder for Penryn, and represented
that borough in Parliament in 1780. On his
entrance into political life he joined Lord North's
party, and was hurried into the fatal coalition;
though the outbreak of the French Revolution considerably
modified his political views, which ultimately
became what we should now call Conservative.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
As illustrative of his electioneering activity,
the following will be interesting, at least to my
Cornish readers:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

Truro. My son has <em>all the lore</em> (they say), but then
he (S<sup>r</sup> F.) has <em>all the money</em>&mdash;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la partie n'est pas
égale!</span>'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Possibly personal pique had something to do
with Sir Francis's desertion of his original political
allies; for I find amongst the Additional MSS. in
the British Museum, a letter in his hand to the
Duke of Portland, on the 20th November, 1783,
relinquishing all connexion with that nobleman's
Government, on account of their having superseded
Sir Francis's nephew, Mr. Morice, as Warden of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Stannaries. 'Ill-usage to myself' (wrote he) 'I
could better have brooked than to my friends.'</p>

<p>In the year 1779, it will be remembered, Plymouth
was threatened by the combined French and Spanish
fleet, and Francis Basset distinguished himself on
the occasion by marching to that town a large
body of the miners' militia, who, under his directions,
rapidly threw up such additional earthworks as were
deemed necessary for the security of that port. This
prompt action on his part gained for him his first title&mdash;his
baronetcy. Indeed, he seems to have had quite
a talent for fortification, for to him also are due the
works of defence of which traces are still to be seen
at Basset's Cove, now better known as Portreath,
and which formerly consisted of one battery of four
12-pounders, and another of two 6-pounders.</p>

<p>Sir Francis evidently took great interest in the affairs
of Rodney, and on 7th June, 1783, moved an address
to the King that a 'lasting provision' might be made
for the gallant Admiral; but, on the Government's
undertaking to see after it, he withdrew his motion.</p>

<p>He opposed the Peace, and argued 'with energy'
against it; but, as the report from which I quote
merely 'preserves the substance of the argument
without the <em>declamation</em>,' we are unfortunately deprived
of this specimen of the Baronet's eloquence.
In November of the same year he seconded the
Address in reply to the King's speech, declaring his
confidence in the Administration, his desire to
alleviate the burdens of the people, his abhorrence
of smuggling, as to which he said he spoke with
some authority, living as he did in a maritime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
county; and, having spoken with tenderness of the
natives of India, whose grievances the Government
had promised to redress, he concluded with a warm
eulogy of the unparalleled successes of Lord Rodney.</p>

<p>Nor did he neglect the arts of peace; deriving as
he did an almost princely income from the mines
which lay within sight of his mansion, he was ever
on the watch for opportunities for developing mining
prosperity, and promoting the moral and social
welfare of the miner. He was deeply interested, too,
in improving the means of locomotion in the county,
and in 1809 laid the first rail of the iron tramway
designed to connect Portreath on the northern shore
of Cornwall with the Gwennap mines.</p>

<p>Moreover, he was a liberal patron of the fine arts,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
and his edition of Carew's 'Survey of Cornwall,'
enriched with Tonkin's notes, and published in 1811,
is one amongst many instances of his public spirit,
and his interest in the affairs of his county.</p>

<p>He lived to the good old age of seventy-seven, but
the end came at last; and on his way to London, to
attend in his place in the House of Peers, he was
seized with paralysis at Exeter. He managed to reach
town, but died at his residence, Stratheden House,
South Place, Knightsbridge, nearly opposite the Hyde
Park Cavalry Barracks, on the 5th February, 1835.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>These were the days before railways, and the
tale is still told in the west country of the magnificent
procession, with its 'outriders and ten pages
on horseback,' which wended its way at a walking-pace
from London to Tehidy, a distance of 300 odd
miles, accomplished in twelve days.</p>

<p>His monument, adorned with a portrait by Westmacott,
stands in Illogan Church; and an epitaph
that does not flatter records that 'his open heart,
his generosity, and universal benevolence, won him
the esteem of all classes, and the affection of those
who intimately knew him. A sincere Christian, an
elegant scholar, the patron of merit, and a munificent
contributor to charitable institutions throughout the
Empire, he proved himself the friend of his country
and of mankind. But, with a laudable partiality, he
especially devoted the chief energies of his mind, and
directed the influence of rank and talents to advance
the moral welfare and to promote the prosperity of
Cornwall, his native county.'</p>

<p>The entailed estates devolved, upon his death, on
his nephew, the before-named John Francis Basset,
from whom they have passed to their present owner,
Gustavus Lambert Basset, Esq., of Tehidy.</p>

<p>The first Baron de Dunstanville left only one
daughter, Frances, who, on her father's decease became
Baroness Basset of Stratton. Noted for her
diligence in charity and all good works, she died at
Tehidy, on 22nd January, 1855, in her seventy-fourth
year, last of her race in the direct line; and in her
the revived, but short-lived, peerage became extinct.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_48_48" id="Footnote_48_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> Playfair says that the first of this family of De Dunstanville, one
Thurston Basset, whom we find on the Roll of Battle Abbey, came over
with the Conqueror. From him sprang <em>many</em> families favoured by our
kings, most of them now extinct. There is a grant of lands from King
John to Wm. Bassett, and Cecilia his wife. In the 'History of the
Manor of Castle Combe, in Wilts, with Memoirs of the Dunstanvilles,'
etc., by Geo. P. Scrope, M.P. (<em>privately printed</em> by J. B. Nichols and
Sons, in 1852), it is stated that Reginald de Dunstanville, Earl of Cornwall,
was first Baron of Castle Combe. There appear to have been
more than one of that name living in the twelfth century; one of them,
perhaps the earliest, was also sometimes named Reginald Fitz-Roy, who
was the son of Henry I. by Adeliza de Insulâ. Reginald, according to
Mr. Scrope's pedigree of the De Dunstanvilles, married Havisia (or
Beatrix), daughter of Caudor, the second Earl of Cornwall, 'ex
Regio sanguine Britannorum.' Adeliza, the sister of Cecilia de Dunstanville,
married another Basset, viz. Thomas, Baron Basset of Hedendon,
10th Henry II. This work contains much minute information about the
early De Dunstanvilles.</p></div>

It is perhaps right to add here (although this is a sketch of the Basset
family, rather than of the De Dunstanvilles) the following notes, which I
have gathered from Carew: 'Walter de Dunstanvil appears to have had
to furnish one knight in respect of his Cornish possessions. See

There was, moreover, a Reginald de Dunstanville, a baron of the realm,

Sir John Basset, chevalier stat.' Hals says (but I cannot conceive
upon what authority) that this castle was built by the Brays, who came
over with the Conqueror (and who certainly intermarried with the
Bassets), and hence the name. But Carn Brea is the appropriate
Cornish form of 'rock-crowned hill.' Parker attributes the Castle to
Robert Fitz Hugh de Dunstanville&mdash;temp. Will. I.</p></div>

great Cornish artist's funeral in 1807; and it may be added that he

 name of Admiral Bligh will always be
associated with that painful episode in
the history of the British Navy&mdash;the
Mutiny of the <i>Bounty</i>&mdash;and the settlement
of the mutineers on Pitcairn and other of the South
Sea Islands; whence we still occasionally obtain
news of their happy and flourishing descendants&mdash;happier
far than their progenitors.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> He is another
example of a Cornish circumnavigator of the globe;
the first being a Michell of Truro, who went round
the world with Sir Francis Drake. Captain Samuel
Wallis, R.N., of Lanteglos juxta Camelford, also
sailed round the world in the <i>Dolphin</i> in 1766-68.</p>

<p>The Admiral was born, in all probability (though
there has been some uncertainty on the subject) on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the Duchy Manor of Tinten,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> in the parish of St. Tudy,
about half a mile south of the 'Church Town,' about
the year 1753,&mdash;the son of Charles and Margaret
Bligh; although I am aware that, according to another
account, he is said to have been the son of John Bligh,
of Tretawne, in the adjoining parish of St. Kew. The
earliest connexion which I have been able to trace
between this family and the parish of St. Tudy is, that
they acquired some property here of the Westlakes, in
1680-81; but there was a John Bligh, or Blygh, at
Bodmin, who acted as an assistant to the Commissioners
for the Suppression of Monasteries, temp.
Henry VIII. To this ancient town a branch of the
Bligh family contributed four mayors between the
years 1505 and 1588&mdash;indeed, the Cornish Blighs may
be traced back as early as the reign of Henry IV. I
am not sure whether or not Admiral Sir Richard
Rodney Bligh, G.C.B, (who died in 1821), was a
member of this family; but he was a Cornishman,
as were some other naval officers of the same name.</p>

<p>Young Bligh&mdash;often called 'Bread-fruit Bligh,' from
his having accompanied Captain Cook,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> as sailing-master
in the <i>Resolution</i>, on his second voyage round
the world, in 1772-74, (in the course of which the fruit
associated with his name was first discovered at
Otaheite)&mdash;became a lieutenant in the Royal Navy;
and, having obtained a high reputation as a skilful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>navigator, was appointed by George III. to command
the <i>Bounty</i>, of 250 tons, on a voyage to Otaheite, in
December 1787. After one or two ineffectual attempts
to round Cape Horn, she arrived at her destination
ten months after leaving England, and remained
there for five or six months, the crew revelling in the
natural beauty of the place, and enjoying an intercourse
(which appears unfortunately to have been
totally unrestricted) with the soft savages, its interesting
inhabitants. On the homeward voyage,
however, laden with plants and specimens of the
bread-fruit, which it had been the object of the
voyage to secure, with a view to its acclimatization
in the British West India Islands, Bligh&mdash;who had
made himself, by his irascible and overbearing disposition,
obnoxious to many of those who sailed with
him&mdash;was secured and bound by the majority of his
crew; and, together with eighteen luckless sailors,
was cast adrift on the 28th April, 1789, in an open
boat only twenty-three feet long, and deeply laden
within 'eight inches of the water's edge,' in which
small, frail craft they sailed 3,618 miles. They had
on board 32 lbs. of pork, 150 lbs. of bread, some wine,
some spirits, and some water&mdash;but <span class="smcap">NO CHART</span>:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Not until nearly twelve months afterwards, did they
reach England; after having touched at one or two
islands, where they got a few shell-fish and some fruit,
and at the Dutch settlement of Timor, to the east of
Java, which they reached on 14th June, 1789, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>

on the 14th March, 1790, with twelve of his companions;
the remainder having died on their weary,
miserable passage.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> To Bligh's skill, resource, and
courage, were due the lives of all who were saved.</p>

<p>So astounding a voyage was, of course, the theme
of conversation throughout the country; Bligh was
immediately promoted to the rank of Commander,
and soon afterwards to that of Post-Captain; shortly
after which he got appointed, in 1791, to the command
of another ship, the <i>Providence</i>, which was sent
on a similar expedition to the Society Islands. On
this occasion fortune was more favourable to the
brave; he did not linger so long amongst the luxurious
islets of the Pacific; and having entirely succeeded
in the object which he had in view, on his
safe return to England received the gold medal of
the Society of Arts in 1794. The practical result of
this voyage was, however, a failure; the quick-growing
plantain being preferred by the West Indians to
the somewhat insipid bread-fruit. As regards the
mutineers, the <i>Pandora</i> was sent out to punish the
ringleaders, some of whom her captain brought back
to Portsmouth (notwithstanding having lost his ship
on the return voyage near the north point of Australia);
and at Portsmouth three of them were executed.
Many of the mutineers, however, hid in the islands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
whose charms, in the beauty of its scenery, climate,
and 'gushing fruits,' and in the hospitable offers of
its chiefs, and still more in the winning ways of
the fairer sex, 'Nature and Nature's goddess&mdash;woman,'
had proved too attractive to insure their
allegiance to their duty. Byron's poem of 'The Island'
is based partly upon the sailors' adventures, and
partly on 'Mariner's Account of the Tonga Islands.'</p>

<p>Bligh also displayed great courage at the mutiny
at the Nore, in 1797; on which occasion he was
deputed to negotiate with the rebellious seamen, and
is said to have performed that dangerous duty with
singular intrepidity and address.</p>

<p>He was present at the memorable battle off the
Dogger Bank, 5th August, 1781; fought under Lord
Howe at Gibraltar in 1782; commanded off Ushant
in 1794, the <i>Warrior</i>, of 74 guns; at Camperdown,
1797, when he was captain of the 64-gun ship
<i>Director</i>; and also at Copenhagen, on 21st May,
1801, when he commanded the <i>Glatton</i>, of 54 guns (a
ship's name still perpetuated in the British navy)&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'When to battle fierce came forth<br /></span>
<span class="i4">All the might of Denmark's crown.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">At the close of this fight Nelson sent for our
Cornish hero, and personally thanked him for the
gallant part which he had taken in that glorious
engagement. In the same year, in consideration of
his distinguished services in navigation, botany, etc.,
he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.</p>

<p>In 1805 he was appointed Captain-General and
Governor of New South Wales, and took up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
office in the following year; but his very arbitrary
disposition and harsh notions of discipline, imbibed
on the quarter-deck, and which, indeed,
distinguished his character throughout life, were
strongly resented by many of his subordinate
officials, both civil and military; and, notwithstanding
that his efforts (which were approved by Lord
Castlereagh) seem to have been mainly directed
towards preventing the unlimited importation of
ardent spirits into the colony, on the 26th January,
1808, Bligh was deposed from his authority by
Major George Johnston, of the 102nd Regiment,
and those who served under him, and was imprisoned
by them until March, 1810.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> In that
year he returned to England in H.M.S. <i>Porpoise</i>, as
to the command of which he had a painful squabble
with her captain&mdash;Kent. He obtained on 31st July,
1811, his flag as Rear-Admiral of the Blue; proceeding
by the usual steps of promotion until he became
Vice-Admiral of the Blue, in June, 1814. This
dignity, however, he did not long enjoy at his
quiet rural retreat at Farningham, in Kent, as he
died in Bond Street, London, on the 7th December,
1817, and was buried (by the side of his wife&mdash;a Miss
Elizabeth Betham, of the Isle of Man) at Lambeth,
in the east part of the ground enclosing the church,
and abutting on the Tradescant tomb. Mrs. Bligh was
a woman of superior attainments; and her father is
described as being the son of the Principal of some
(unnamed) university, and himself a literary man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the friend of Hume, Black, Adam Smith, and
Robertson. Bligh left six daughters and three sons,
William, Henry, and Richard (the latter a barrister-at-law
and author of several legal works) who sold
the Tinten property, and thus terminated the connexion
of this family with the county of Cornwall.</p>

<p>Admiral Bligh's epitaph records that 'he was that
celebrated navigator who first transplanted the
bread-fruit tree from Otaheite to the West Indies;
bravely fought the battles of his country; and died
beloved, respected, and lamented.'</p>

<p>He seems to have been a lenient and benevolent
despot in his dealings towards the poor, of which
many instances are recorded by J. D. Lang, Jas.
Bonwick, R. Therry, and other colonial writers; and&mdash;a
good sign&mdash;he was very fond of little children.</p>

<p>Dr. Alfred Gatty, tells us how, when he went as a
boy to Farningham, Admiral Bligh used to take him
on his knee, and let him play with a bullet that hung
on a blue ribbon round his neck&mdash;the same bullet
which he used as a weight for doling out the daily
portion of bread to his crew and to himself during
their long boat-voyage of nearly 4,000 miles.</p>

<p>The Admiral's hasty temper, his room full of
books, and his sea curiosities, of course attracted the
boy's attention, and more especially a scar on his
cheek, about which the old gentleman told him the
following story. When George III. at a levée asked
him in what action he had been wounded, Bligh
was obliged to acknowledge, with some confusion,
that it was not a battle-wound; but that his father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
in throwing a hatchet to turn a horse which they were
both trying to catch in an orchard, accidentally
struck him on the cheek.</p>

<p>As regards his family, the following additional
remarks may prove not unacceptable:</p>

<p>Lady O'Connell, one of Bligh's daughters, seems
to have inherited some of her father's spirit, for she
is said to have defended him on one occasion with a
pistol 'against rebels,' in Van Diemen's Land.
Frances and Jane were twins. Ann was a beauty, but
mentally afflicted. On one occasion the young ladies
were followed home from Farningham Church by a
stranger, who was the subject of a little hoax played
upon him by the Misses Bligh. He had advertised
for a wife, and they replied to the advertisement by
requesting him to appear, blowing his nose demonstratively,
in the aisle of the church; by which process
he was to be recognised. But so were also
Frances and Jane Bligh; for they found it impossible
to conceal their laughter at the would-be Benedict's
performance, and their dupe accordingly followed
them home after the service. Here, however, he
was received by the Admiral himself with such
emphatic broadsides that the wooer very quickly
'hauled off.'</p>

<p>Bligh's House at Farningham was, and is still
known as the Manor House; and having heard that it
still contained a picture of one of the Admiral's sea-fights,
I asked my obliging correspondent, Mr. H. G.
Hewlett (then living at Mount Pleasant, Farningham),
to ascertain the facts for me, with the following result:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'I sent over to the Manor House yesterday to obtain
a report upon the picture; but, unfortunately, it
is hung in the chamber of a maiden lady, who demurred
to admitting visitors. They could only learn
that it is a naval battle-piece, in which several men-of-war
take part; that the scene is off the coast, and that
several figures are wading to shore. Its size is about
3 ft. by 2 ft.; the carving round the picture, which is let
into the wall, is said to be fine. The room is called
Admiral Bligh's, and is supposed to be haunted by his
ghost, which stumps about on a wooden leg! Miss
K&mdash;&mdash;, however, is not superstitious, it appears, and
has not heard or seen the ghost!'</p></div>

<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">In</span>
 the Churchwardens' Accounts for the
parish of St. Mary Woolnoth, in the City
of London, are the following entries,
the first of which (and one of the earliest
in the book) makes mention of a Sir John Percyvall,
who had a chantry in that church. He was Sheriff in
1486, and Lord Mayor in 1498; received the honour
of knighthood from Henry VII., and died circa 1504.</p>

<p>The second, dated 1539, runs as follows: 'It'm

Taillors for the beme light of this Churche
according to the devise of Dame Thomasyn Percyvall,
widow, late wyf of Sir John Percyvall, knight,
decessed, xxvj<sup>s</sup> viii<sup>d</sup>.'</p>

<p>A third runs: 'It'm receyved more of the Maister

th'oon of xv lb. and the other of v lb. to burne about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the sepulchure in this Chirch at Ester Sunday, and

gyve attendance at the obit of S<sup>r</sup> John Percyvall
and of his wyfe according to the devyse of the said
Dame Thomasyn Percyvall his wyf iiij<sup>l</sup>, vi<sup>s</sup> iiij<sup>d</sup>.'</p>

<p>And the last: 'It'm receyved of the said Maister
and Wardenns of Merchant-taillours for the reparacions
of the ornaments of this Chirche according to
the will of the said S<sup>r</sup> John Percyvall vj<sup>s</sup>.'</p>

<p>Herbert, in his 'History of the Livery Companies
of London,' gives the following particulars of the
estates out of the proceeds of which the above funds
were paid, viz.: 'So far as S<sup>r</sup> John was concerned,
the annual sum of 16s. 4d. and £13 6s. 8d., issuing
from certain messuages of the Company; and (as
regards Dame Thomazine) the sums of 53s. 4d.,
21s. 4d., and 13s. 10d., and 20s. yearly, all of
the premises being situate in the parishes of St.
Mary Wolnoth, St. Michael Cornhill, St. Martin
Vintry, and St. Dionysius (or Denis) Back-Church,
in Fenchurch Street.' He also gives an account of
the manner in which the said funds were disposed
of: as, good round sums to priests 'for singing
for Sir John;' to priests and clerks for ringing of
bells at the obits; for wax to burn on those occasions;
sundry sums for the poor, etc.; for the
'conduct for keeping the anthem;' and, amongst
other disbursements, ten shillings 'for a potation
to the neighbours at the said obit.'</p>

<p>The charities left by this benevolent couple are
also set out at p. 502 of the same work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>And lastly, the Stratton Churchwardens' Accounts
for 1513, show that on the day on which 'my <em>lady
parcyvale's</em> meneday' came round (<em>i.e.</em> the day on
which her death was to be <em>had in mind</em>), prayer was
to be made for the repose of her soul, and two shillings
and twopence paid to two priests, and for bread
and ale.</p>

<p>This, I believe, is nearly all that exists in the
shape of documentary evidence to bear record of
the existence of the Cornish girl who forms the subject
of this notice. There are, however, still to be
seen in the remote and quiet little village of Week
St. Mary, some five or six miles south of Bude, in
the northern corner of Cornwall, the substantial
remains of the good Thomasine's College and
Chantry, which she founded for the instruction of
the youth of her native place.</p>

<p>The buildings lie about a hundred yards east of
the church (from the summit of whose grotesquely
ornamented tower six-and-twenty parish churches
may be discerned); and, built into the modern wall
of a cottage which stands inside the battlemented
enclosure, is a large, carved granite stone (evidently
one of two which once formed the tympanum of a
doorway) on which the letter <span class="largeb">T</span> stands out in bold
relief. Probably it is the initial of the Christian
name of our Thomasine; at any rate it is pleasant
to think it may be such.</p>

<p>The traditions, however, concerning her are not
only still numerous in the neighbourhood, but are as
implicitly believed as if they were recorded by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
most unimpeachable of chroniclers. They have
been embodied, not without considerable imaginative
embellishment, by the late Rev. R. S. Hawker of
Morwenstow, in a pleasant chapter in his charming
'Footprints of Men of Former Times in Cornwall,'
and they are somewhat as follows:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Thomasine Bonaventura was a poor shepherd
maiden, and tended her sheep&mdash;'the long-forgotten
Cornish knott'<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>&mdash;on the wild moorlands of North
Cornwall, in days when more attention was paid
than in later times to the produce of the flocks, and
less was devoted, at least in this part of the county,
to the mineral resources which lie hid in its bosom.
Even the wealthy merchants of London came down
so far into the west country to buy wool; and it
was probably about the middle of the fifteenth century
when one 'Richard Bunsby,' a citizen of the
metropolis, made his appearance on the scene,
which opens on the banks of one of the many little
moorland streams that run down from Greena Moor
in Week St. Mary, sweeping round Marham Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Hill, and so into Bude Haven. Struck with the
shepherdess's bright looks and intelligent remarks,
he proposed that she should return to London with
him, and become a domestic servant in his house;
and Thomasine's parents having given their consent
to so brilliant a proposal, as it seemed to them, to
London she went, and received on her arrival a
hearty welcome from her new mistress. In course
of time she became a great favourite with all in the
house, the manager of its concerns, and, on the
death of Dame Bunsby, the old merchant married
his Cornish housekeeper, in compliance with the
express wish of his late wife. Three years afterwards,
Richard Bunsby, too, died, leaving all his
property to Thomasine; and thus she became a
wealthy widow. Yet did she not forget her husband's
memory, to which she caused to be erected (so it is
said) a substantial bridge; a structure (or perhaps I
should say its modern representative), which may still
be seen, as it was by myself in the autumn of 1880,
at Week Ford.</p>

<p>One so 'sweet and serviceable,' and withal so
rich, was not long, we may be sure, without suitors;
and so, after a while, we find Thomasine again
married; this time to 'that worshipful merchant
adventurer, Master John Gall, of St. Lawrence,
Milk Street.' He, too, was wealthy and uxorious;
and enabled his wife to confer many benefits on the
poor of her native place, for which she seems to have
always entertained a lingering fondness&mdash;a trait as
characteristic of the Cornish as of the Swiss themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
After the lapse, however, of five years,
Thomasine found herself once more alone in the
world; and again her husband had left her all his
property.</p>

<p>She had not to wait long before many fresh lovers
were at the feet of the 'Golden Widow;' and on
this occasion, in the year 1497, she bestowed her hand
upon Sir John Percyvall, who was, the year after their
marriage, elected to the honourable post of Lord
Mayor of London. In memory of this event, she is
reported to have constructed a good new road down
to the coast, which I am bound to say I have not
succeeded in identifying,&mdash;though it may be that
which runs from Week St. Mary, over Week Ford
and through Poundstock, to either Wansum or
Melhuc Mouth.</p>

<p>She long survived even her third husband; and
retiring, as it is believed, to Week St. Mary, by her
will, made in 1510, left goodly sums of money to the
home of her childhood. She directed that the
'chauntry with cloisters' (to which reference has
already been made) should be built there; and that
a school should be founded for the children of the
poor.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>If Mr. Hawker's testimony is to be accepted, she
also left, by a codicil to her will, and in memory of
an early love affair, to the priest of the church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
where she knew her cousin John Dineham would serve
and sing, 'the silver chalice gilt, which good Master
Maskelyne had devised for her behoof, with a little
blue flower which they do call a "forget-me-not,"
wrought in Turkess at the bottom of the bowl.'
But Mr. Hawker's mind was always full of graceful
fancies; and he has in this case undoubtedly
drawn upon his imagination for his facts.</p>

<p>Carew is a more reliable if less poetic authority. He
says: 'And to show that virtue as well bare a part in
the desert, as fortune in the means of her preferment,
she employed the whole residue of her life and
last widowhood to works no less bountiful than
charitable; namely, repairing of highways, building
of bridges, endowing of maidens, relieving of
prisoners, feeding and apparelling the poor, etc.
Among the rest, at this St. Mary Wike she founded
a chantry and free-school, together with fair lodgings
for the schoolmasters, scholars, and officers, and
added £20 of yearly revenue for supporting the incident
charges: wherein, as the bent of her desire
was holy, so God blessed the same with all wished
success; for divers of the best gentlemen's sons of
Devon and Cornwall were there virtuously trained
up, in both kinds of divine and human learning,
under one Cholwel, an honest and religious teacher,
which caused the neighbours so much the rather,
and the more to rue, that a petty smack only of
popery opened the gap to the oppression of the
whole, by the statute made in Edward VI.'s reign,
touching the suppression of chanteries.'</p>

<p class="drop-capi2"><span class="smcap">Amongst</span>
 the worthies of Truro who have
left 'footprints on the sands of time,'
there are few more deserving of remembrance
than Henry Bone, the only Royal
Academician that his native place ever produced.
He was born on February the 6th, 1755, and was
the son of a cabinet-maker and carver, who is said
to have been a clever workman, and to have carved
the old pulpit of St. Mary's Church, Truro. One of
the same name, and perhaps of the same family,
a Walter Bone, was Mayor of Truro in 1708. In
1767 the family removed to Plymouth, and in 1771
Bone, showing artistic tastes, was apprenticed to
the ingenious William Cookworthy, a druggist there,
who discovered the secret of making hard-paste
porcelain, in England, out of Cornish granite and
clay, and who thereupon established the Plymouth
China Works. In 1772 Bone's master removed to
Bristol, where, in conjunction with the Champions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
to whom he had become related by marriage, Cookworthy
established the equally celebrated Bristol
Porcelain Works. Bone accompanied him; and
here he remained until 1778, working from six in the
morning to six in the evening in the factory, and
after that improving himself in the art of drawing.
It is considered that the best painting executed at
the Bristol Works was by Bone, and he is believed
to have used the figure 1 in addition to the factory-mark

<p>On the failure in business of his new master,
Champion, in 1778, Bone, in the following year,
came to London, with one guinea of his own in his
pocket, and £5 lent to him by his friend, Morris,
a cooper. At first he found employment in enameling
watches, etc.; but this work failing him, owing
to a change of the fashion, he commenced miniature-painting
in water-colours on ivory, and also in
enamel. Here it may be noted that he was employed
first on enamel-painting, etc., by Randle and
Co., Paternoster Row; and also on painting fans for
Crowder and Co., Foster Lane. His distinguishing
excellence is said to have been that he used enamel
paints just as other colours, instead of, according to
the feeble practice of the day, first mixing <em>on the
palette</em> every colour to be used. His predecessor in
this art was Horace Hone; but the latter's work was,
in many respects, very inferior to that of the Cornish
artist.</p>

<p>Dr. Wolcot (Peter Pindar) early recognised his
merit, as he also did that of Opie, and recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Bone to make annual painting tours into Cornwall;
but increasing work in town compelled him at length
to give up these congenial trips. On the 24th
January, 1780, he married Elizabeth Vandermeulen,
a descendant of Philip Vandermeulen, battle-painter
to William III.; and Bone's first picture, exhibited at
the Royal Academy in the same year, was an enamel
painting of his newly-married wife. This enamel
was of the then unusual size of two and a half inches
in height, and Bone's complete success on this occasion
led him now to determine on setting up on his
own account instead of working for others. In 1782
his own portrait followed. These works brought
him into prominent notice, and numerous patrons
came to his studio. Giving his entire attention now
to enamel-painting,&mdash;which has been well called
'painting for eternity,'&mdash;he completed, in 1789, 'A
Muse and Cupid,' from his own design, of a greater
size than had ever before been executed by this
process.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>In 1794 we find him exhibiting 'The Sleeping
Girl,' after Sir Joshua Reynolds; and in 1797 a portrait
of Lord Eglinton, which attracted the attention
of the Prince of Wales, who appointed him, in 1800,
his enamel-painter, and became a generous patron to
him afterwards. In the following year he was
elected Associate of the Royal Academy, and enamel-painter
to George III.; and he occupied the same
post under George IV. and William IV. He subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
executed several fine enamels, mostly after
Sir Joshua Reynolds, and also a fine piece after
Leonardo da Vinci. On 15th April, 1811, he was
elected Royal Academician, and shortly after produced
the largest enamel which had ever been
painted up to that time, viz., a copy of the 'Bacchus
and Ariadne' in the National Gallery, after Titian,
eighteen by sixteen inches. This picture was considered
so marvellous a production that more than
4,000 persons went to inspect it at Bone's house;
and it was at length sold to Mr. G. Bowles, of
Cavendish Square and Wanstead, for 2,200 guineas.
The story goes, on the authority of Mr. George Bone,
of Blackheath, that this sum was paid in the form of
a cheque drawn on Fauntleroy's Bank. Bone cashed
it on his way home, in order to have the pleasure of
showing to his wife so huge a sum in coin. The
following day the notorious forgeries and frauds were
discovered, and the firm was bankrupt. But according
to a writer in the 'Annual Biography' for 1836, who
seems to have been well acquainted with Bone, the
amount was paid partly in cash and partly by a draft.</p>

<p>Bone next undertook, in addition to enamel
portraits and copies from the ancient masters, a
series of historical portraits, mostly of the time of
Elizabeth. They were of great merit, but unsuccessful
financially. These were exhibited at his
house, 15 Berners Street, near that of his friend
Opie, No. 8, who painted Bone's portrait.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
were also portraits of the Cavaliers distinguished in
the Civil War, painted for J. P. Old; as well as portraits
of the Russell family, from the reign of Henry
VII., for the Duke of Bedford. A catalogue of the
last-named was privately printed in 1825, and there
is a copy of it in the South Kensington Museum.</p>

<p>In 1831 failing eyesight compelled him to retire to
Somers Town, and reluctantly to receive the Academy
pension; but owing to the expensive professions
adopted by his sons, there was no alternative. Here
he died of paralysis on December 17th, 1834. Some
time before his death Bone offered his works, which
were valued at £10,000, to the nation for £4,000.
This offer was declined, and some time afterwards,
viz., 22nd April, 1836, they were sold by auction at
Christie and Manson's, realizing about 2,000 guineas,
and so were scattered far and wide. Other important
sales of Bone's enamels took place on the
following dates, viz.: 1st May, 1846; 25th April,
1850; 10th May, 1854; and 13th and 14th March,
1856.</p>

<p>Bone had a large family&mdash;twelve, it is believed; of
whom ten survived. His eldest son, Henry Pierce
Bone, born November 6th, 1779, first exhibited at the
Academy in 1799. He commenced enamel-painting
in 1833, was appointed enamel-painter to Queen
Adelaide, and afterwards to her present Majesty and
the Prince Consort; and in the course of fifty-six
years he exhibited 210 miniatures and enamels. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
died in London, October 21st, 1855. Bone's grandsons
(W. Bone and C. K. Bone) are also enamelers.</p>

<p>Robert Trewick Bone, the third son, born September
24th, 1790, was a subject-painter of some
ability. He died from the effects of a hurt, May 5th,
1840. One son, Thomas, a midshipman, was wrecked
and drowned, in the <i>Racehorse</i>, sloop, off the Isle of
Man. Another, Peter, a lieutenant in the 36th
Regiment, was wounded at the battle of Toulouse,
and died soon after his return to England; and
another of Bone's sons was called to the bar.</p>

<p>Of Henry Bone's private character, it was truly
said, by one who knew him well, that 'unaffected
modesty, generosity, friendship, and undeviating integrity
adorned his private life;' and as to his artistic
merits, it is no exaggeration to say that he was 'unequalled
in Europe for the perfect truth and enduring
brilliancy of his productions.'</p>

<p>A voluminous list, prepared by the late Mr. J.
Jope Rogers, of the works of art produced by the
various members of the Bone family, will be found in
the 'Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall,'
No. XXII., for March, 1880. It shows a total of
1,063 recorded works by this gifted family, nearly
half of which were painted by the principal subject
of this brief memoir.</p>

<p>Chantrey executed a fine bust of Henry Bone,
which has been well engraved by Thomson; and
there is another portrait of him, as an elderly man,
which was painted by Harlow, and engraved by F.
C. Lewis in 1824.</p>

<p class="drop-capi2"><span class="smcap">The</span>
 little parish of Ludgvan<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> (or as it is
sometimes called, Ludgvan-Lees), on the
north shore of the Mount's Bay, can
boast of having contributed at least its
share to the list of illustrious Cornishmen. Small,
remote, and obscure as it is, Ludgvan is one of the
places mentioned as the birthplace of Sir Humphry
Davy; it was for more than half a century the residence
of the subject of this article; and here, too,
at Tremenheere, was born one of the most illustrious
professors of the healing art that the county has ever
produced&mdash;himself the friend and medical attendant
of Borlase and of Pope&mdash;I refer to Dr. William
Oliver, of Bath.</p>

<p>That the pursuits of a keen inquirer, endowed with
no ordinary powers of observation and considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
artistic talent, should, in such an out-of-the-way
corner of England as Ludgvan still is, have been
directed towards natural history, and to the megalithic
remains of antiquity with which the neighbourhood
once abounded, and of which there are
still numerous examples, is not to be wondered at.
And it cannot be denied that the study of those
sciences, both in Cornwall and elsewhere, was
materially benefited by the numerous and careful
drawings and descriptions of the stone monuments
of a mysterious and almost unknown race of men,
which it was one of the main objects of Dr. Borlase's
learned leisure to investigate and record. Many of
these ancient remains have altogether disappeared
since his time, and many others have been mutilated
or altered; but in the Doctor's volumes such minute
descriptions of them have been preserved that the
loss of the monuments themselves has been rendered
of much less serious importance than would have
been the case but for his careful and elaborate
records. Of the deductions and suggestions which
are appended to those descriptions something will be
said hereafter.</p>

<p>But, in accordance with the method adopted in
the case of the other Worthies of Cornwall, it is well
first to say something of the stock from which Dr.
Borlase sprang. A Norman origin is claimed for the
family&mdash;they are said to have descended from one
Taillefer: presumably some connexion of him who is
reported to have struck the first blow at the Battle
of Hastings. Coming into Cornwall, as, by the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
very few other followers of the Norman Conqueror
did, the Borlases seem to have adopted a custom
which has always more or less prevailed in the county
of merging their own name into that of their place of
residence; and here it may be observed that the name
of Borlase, supposed by some to mean 'the high green
summit,' is still attached to two or three little homesteads
in the parish of St. Wenn, three or four miles
north-east of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text 'St. Columb-Major'">St. Columb Major.</ins><a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The direct male
line became extinct in the time of Elizabeth, when
the coheiresses married a Tonkin and a Bray; and
the family does not appear to have risen to any
distinction until they moved farther westward, and
about the middle of the seventeenth century took
up their abode (which is still in the possession of a
member of the family) at Pendeen, in the parish of
St. Just.</p>

<p>The early Pendeen Borlases seem to have been
staunch Royalists, for it seems that one of them
assisted his cousin, Colonel Nicholas Borlase, in
raising a troop of horse for the King. Of this troop
a writer in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> for 1875, quotes the
following story:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Being on one occasion much pressed by the
Puritan forces, and making a running fight, he set
fire to a large brake of furze in the night, which the
enemy taking for the fires made on the approach of
the King's army, immediately fled with great precipitation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and left him both bag and baggage, which
he seized the next morning.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>By way of comment on these proceedings, Fairfax
quartered some of his troopers at Pendeen,&mdash;doubtless
to the intense annoyance of the owner thereof; and
as regards Colonel Nicholas, a letter from Cromwell
to Lenthall tells all that I have been able to gather
as to that hero's career. It is dated Edinburgh,
13th June, 1651, and asks the Speaker to hasten the
hearing of Borlase's case, which seems to have been
involved in the conditions of the hurried treaty of
Truro, when Hopton surrendered to Fairfax, and
terminated the supremacy of the Royal cause in the
West country.</p>

<p>The Borlases were not, however, without some sort
of barren reward for their faithfulness to the Stuart
cause; for Humphry, who was Sheriff of Cornwall
during the last two years of the reign of James II.,
was created a peer by that monarch <em>after his abdication</em>.
Under these circumstances he, of course, never
enjoyed the title. He sometimes resided at Truthan,
in the parish of St. Erme, near Truro, and left his
estates to the Borlases of Pendeen.</p>

<p>Dr. Borlase was born at Pendeen, on 2nd February,
1695, the second son of his father, 'John of Pendeen,
twice Member of Parliament for St. Ives in Cornwall
in the reign of Queen Anne, and Lydia Harris, of
Hayne, county Devon, his wife,' a lady descended, so
the writer in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> informs us, through
the Nevilles and Bouchiers, from Edward III. But
the Borlases had also plenty of good Cornish blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
in their veins; and amongst other old families of the
soil with whom they intermarried may be named their
not very distant neighbours, the Godolphins.</p>

<p>With a member of the last-named family John
Borlase seems to have had an altercation one day in
church, the particulars of which are set forth in his
victim's petition to Parliament as follows, viz.:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'<span class="smcap">Honoured Sirs</span>,</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Life, the precious tenet of mankind,
forceth me to inform your honours that Sunday, the
26th February, 1709, in full view of most of the congregation
of Maddern, John Borlase, one of Her
Majesty's Justices of the Peace, did wilfully break
the peace by striking me almost to the ground with
his staff, and if not timely prevented by one Paul
Tonkin, he would have been striking me again. He
did at the same time highly threaten me, with Chrit<sup>r</sup>.
Harris, Esq., Jane his wife, and John his son. Mr.
Harris ordered his servant to beat me. Of the truth
of the above information I am ready to give my
corroboration. Humbly craving the Honble. Speaker
and House of Commons not to skreene such daring
offenders, but to give me leave to prosecute them
as the law directs, is the humble prayer of, Hond.
Sirs,</p>

<p class="center">'Your in all humility and duty,</p>
<p class="right">'<span class="smcap">Ffrances Godolphin.' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>What this poor gentleman had done to deserve the
'Justice's justice' thus summarily inflicted on him,
observes the writer in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
whom I quote this letter, there and then, in the midst
as it seems of divine service, and by the occupant
of the next pew, we are left to conjecture.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pendeen<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> is a house of unusual interest in this part
of Cornwall, where, indeed, primæval remains abound,
but where are few examples&mdash;save small and (with
one or two exceptions) not particularly interesting
churches&mdash;of mediæval and later architecture. It is
now occupied as a farmhouse, but was formerly a
place of much more importance. Substantially built
of native granite, the structure was evidently designed
for the occupation of some prosperous man; and its
ground-plot indicates that it was so traced as to be
capable of some sort of defence against marauders.
In one of the bedrooms&mdash;most probably that in
which William Borlase first saw the light&mdash;are some
curious figures on the wall, of which a sketch is
preserved by the writer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But it is not so much to the house itself as to its
surroundings that we must look for what were probably
the determining circumstances of Borlase's
career. He was in the very heart of the cromlehs,
the cliff-castles, the weird stone-circles, and the huge
monoliths of a forgotten race; and, close to the house,
there was a long and mysterious double cave&mdash;a vau
or ogou&mdash;which, we can but believe, must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
excited an inquiring child's awe-struck interest. We
are indebted chiefly to himself for the little that we
know of his early days; and this information is
derived from a modest autobiographical sketch which
he drew up in 1772, when seventy-seven years old, for
his friend Huddesford, the Curator of the Ashmolean
Museum, at Oxford, an institution to which Borlase
contributed nearly the whole of his collections of
natural history and antiquities.</p>

<p>His first school seems to have been at the nearest
town, Penzance; and of him his master said what so
many a master has said of many another apt but
dreamy and indolent scholar, who was nevertheless
destined afterwards to distinguish himself, that 'he
could learn, but would not.' Thence he went, in
1709, under the tuition of the Rev. Mr. Bedford, at
Plymouth, where he seems to have profited more by
the instruction which he received. It has also been
supposed that he was educated partly at Tiverton
School. In March, 1712-13 he was entered, Cornish
fashion, at Exeter College, Oxford, and here he took
his B.A. and M.A. degrees in due course; was in
1719 ordained deacon; and in 1720, priest.</p>

<p>Dr. Borlase gives the following picture of the
Oxford of his days:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'When I was at Oxford in the year 1715, we&mdash;I
mean pupils, tutors, barbers, shoe-cleaners, and bed-makers&mdash;minded
nothing but Politics; the Muse
stood neglected; nay meat and drink, balls and
ladies, had all reason to complain in their turns that
we minded Scotland and Preston more than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
humane, softer, and more delicate entertainments of
Genius and Philosophy. This was a most unhappy
time, and I have often lamented it.' And he concludes
with the strong Conservative opinion: 'If I
can see anything in our English history, 'tis that the
poor nation is always the worse for alterations,
tho' particular persons may be the better, that is,
the richer or more powerful.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>His amusing description of a journey home from
the University with Sir John St. Aubyn, in 1722, is
given hereafter in the chapter on that family.</p>

<p>Two years after he was ordained priest, and (his
father having bought for him the next presentation) he
was presented to the living of Ludgvan, by Charles,
first Duke of Bolton, through the influence, as Nichols
inaccurately tells us, of Sir William Morice, of Werrington&mdash;a
family with whom the St. Aubyns intermarried.
This living he held for fifty-two years.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>When Borlase settled in his Rectory, the retired
situation of the place did not altogether prevent his
indulging in the mild social dissipations of the neighbourhood;
notably there was a bowling-green club,
formed in 1719, which proved an agreeable means of
meeting with his friends, and afforded Mr. Gwavas&mdash;one
of the latest writers in the old Cornish language,
and a member of the party&mdash;an opportunity of composing
a set of verses in Cornish in honour of the
foundation of the club.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt, from what we know of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
his surroundings and proclivities, that Borlase was
already making notes of the neighbouring antiquities,
and dipping into his favourite authorities&mdash;the best of
the day&mdash;for information, which he was afterwards to
apply in a somewhat too speculative manner, to his
pet subject&mdash;the Druids. He seems to have relied
mainly for this purpose upon several passages in
Julius Cæsar, Pliny, Elias Schedius de Diis Germanis,
Smith's 'Syntagma de Druidis;' a collection
of the French and German writers in Frickius de
Druidis, Sheringham, Sammes, Montfaucon, Mons.
Martin's 'Religion of the Ancient Gauls,' Toland's
'History of the Druids,' Rowland's 'Mona Illustrata,'
Dr. Stukeley in his 'Stonehenge and Abury,' and
Keysler in his 'Antiquities.'<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>His method was to examine, and especially to survey
and to <em>draw</em> carefully the old weather-beaten stone
structures of Cornwall; being convinced, as he says,
'of the necessity of copying the original monuments,'
and 'offering something to the public which their
<em>undeniable</em> properties suggested.' We shall, however,
I think, presently see that, in endeavouring to carry
out this method, the worthy antiquary was rather
prone to do that which so many other investigators
have done&mdash;namely, to see that which he <em>wished</em> to
see.</p>

<p>Fortunately for him, and for the records of the
'Cornish Antiquities,' when he married (as he did in
1724) Anne Smith, the daughter of the then Rector
of Camborne and Illogan&mdash;'peramatæ, amanti,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
amabili,' as he wrote for her epitaph&mdash;he found a
partner who (again to use his own words) took 'more
than her part of the domestic cares,' in order that
he might the better prosecute his antiquarian researches.
The marriage ceremony was performed
by his elder brother the Rev. Walter Borlase, LL.D.,
of Castle Horneck (the seat of the family on their
removing from Pendeen, about a century and a half
ago), afterwards Vice-Warden of the Stannaries from
1761 to 1776.</p>

<p>Although he lived to a very ripe old age, his health
seems to have somewhat failed him for a time in
1730; and he accordingly repaired to Bath, as the
waters were then in high repute for maladies such
as his, in order to be under the care of his friend
Dr. Oliver, who happily cured him, and gave him
'a new lease of life.' There can be little doubt
that this excursion was also of great importance
in another way; for it was here, and at this
time, that he made the acquaintance of Pope,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
of Ralph Allen, and of many other well-known
characters in the literary and scientific world, who
afterwards became his correspondents. His clever
pencil was also employed during his sojourn at Bath
in designing the obelisk in Orange Grove&mdash;so named
after the Prince of Orange&mdash;another of those persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
who credited the renowned Bath waters with the
power of renewing their youth.</p>

<p>In 1732 Dr. Borlase's elder brother, Walter, died;
and thereupon the subject of this memoir had the
Vicarage of St. Just added to his previous preferment.
This second living he held for the long period
of forty years. The two places were not so far apart
(only about twelve miles) as to preclude his giving
attention to both cures; and indeed those biographers
who have written of Borlase (notably
Chalmers), state that his performance of his clerical
duties was highly praiseworthy, being marked with
'the most rigid punctuality and exemplary dignity.'
At St. Just, a populous mining parish, his congregation
often consisted of 1,000 persons on a Sunday
morning, and 500 in the afternoon. This, too, it
must be remembered, was at a time when Churchmanship
generally was at a very low ebb in Cornwall,
and needed Wesley's trumpet-call to arouse it.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding his increased responsibilities,
Borlase did not neglect his antiquarian and scientific
studies, nor his out-of-door pursuits of gardening and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
planting, for which the mild air of Ludgvan was
highly favourable. In fact, at this period he seems
to have 'entered upon the study of Druid learning'
with renewed fervour. His chief companions were
Sir John St. Aubyn of St. Michael's Mount hard by,
and the Rev. Edward Collins of St. Erth, the latter
of whom appears to have joined in nearly all his
rambles, and not to have failed to administer occasionally
'the salutary censure of a friend;' for, as
Borlase himself tells us, he found Mr. Collins a useful
'check in some disquisitions.'</p>

<p>Thus tranquilly passed away some fifteen years of
this quiet and uneventful, but busy life,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> until circumstances
again brought him into contact with that
outer world of larger and more learned minds which
'do mostly congregate in cities.' In 1748 he went to
Exeter, to be present at the ordination of his eldest
son. Here he was introduced to the Dean of Exeter,
the Rev. Dr. Charles Lyttelton, afterwards Bishop
of Carlisle, and the first President of the Society of
Antiquaries. And it is not a little curious to note,
by the way, that Dr. Lyttelton's successor as Dean
of Exeter, Jeremiah Milles, of Duloe in Cornwall,
also succeeded his predecessor in the Deanery in the
distinguished post of President of the Antiquaries.
It can readily be believed that new sources of intellectual
enjoyment opened up with an acquaintance
with such men as these. They forthwith
became correspondents; and to their names were
added, either about this time or at other periods of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Borlase's life, those of Linnæus, Gronov of Leyden,
Stukeley, Atterbury (Bishop of Rochester), Browne
Willis, Pococke (Bishop of Ossory), Thomas Pennant,
and Ellis, the author of the 'Corallines.' The library
at Castle Horneck contains upwards of forty volumes
in MS. of Borlase's Correspondence and Notes.</p>

<p>One of the fruits of Borlase's visit to Exeter was the
production of his first essay (or 'Exercise' as it was
termed) for the 'Philosophical Transactions.' This
appeared in 1749. It was the first scientific account
of any of the Cornish minerals; and was entitled
'Spar, and Sparry Productions, called Cornish Diamonds.'
This was considered of sufficient merit to
secure his election as Fellow of the Royal Society,
an honour which was conferred upon him on his
visit to London in the following year. Many other
contributions followed, nineteen in all; chiefly on
subjects connected with meteorology and natural
phenomena, and one paper of an antiquarian character.
They are catalogued in the 'Biographia
Britannica,' vol. ii., p. 425.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the time had now arrived when Borlase felt
himself strong enough to invite the attention of the
world to more considerable works from his pen and
pencil. And first he turned his attention to grouping
and arranging the results of his archæological
researches, the publication of which, by subscription,
he set about accomplishing. It was not, however,
until 1753 that he saw his way clear to taking
the MSS. of his 'Cornish Antiquities' with him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Oxford&mdash;preferring that city to London for two
reasons, the first of which we can easily understand,
viz., its greater retirement; but the second is one
which sounds strange to modern ears, because of
the '<em>more ready access to books</em>.' So great was his
diligence, and that of his engravers, that the work,
in folio, with its numerous illustrations, was published
at Oxford in February of the following year, 1754;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
and the indefatigable author at once returned to
Cornwall in order to arrange the materials for
his next great work, the 'Natural History' of his
native county. Meanwhile, in 1756, appeared his
account of the Scilly Islands, an enlargement of one
of his papers in the 'Philosophical Transactions,'
and a work of which Dr. Johnson wrote in the
<cite>Literary Review</cite> that 'This is one of the most pleasing
and elegant pieces of local inquiry that our
country has produced.'</p>

<p>On this occasion, too, he seems to have proceeded
with his usual despatch; for in October, 1757, we
find him once more at Oxford, for the purpose of
printing the last-named work. And again, by the
spring of the following year, 1758, this too was ready
for the public eye.</p>

<p>Having now secured in print the results of so
many years' labours, the happy idea occurred to him
of presenting to his beloved University the collections
of antiquities, natural history, etc., upon which
his works were based, and he accordingly deposited
them forthwith in the Ashmolean Museum, continuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
to send thither from time to time any similar
rarities which he discovered. It is scarcely necessary
to add that for this generous gift he received
the thanks of the University; which, in token of the
high appreciation in which they held his talents and
his liberality, on the 23rd March, 1766, conferred on
him, by diploma, the degree of Doctor of Laws, the
highest academical honour which it was in the power
of the University to bestow.</p>

<p>But Borlase was now getting an old man, being over
seventy years of age. The friends of his youth were
dying off; and he was unable to undertake the long
antiquarian rambles which had been the delight of
his stalwart days. His outdoor amusements began to
be restricted to the superintendence (which he seems
to have thoroughly enjoyed) of the improvement of
the numerous roads which ran through his parish;
one of which, it may be mentioned, was the highroad
to Penzance, until that which now skirts the
shore of the Mount's Bay was substituted for it.
His literary labours consisted partly in writing his
'Sacræ Exercitationes,' which were chiefly paraphrases
of Ecclesiastes, the Canticles of Solomon,
and the Lamentations of Jeremiah&mdash;rather for his
own pleasure than with any view to publication; and
his home recreations were the 'Belles Lettres' and
drawing and painting. He did not, however, neglect
entirely his old pursuits; for he prepared for the press
the new and enlarged edition of his 'Antiquities,'
which, as we have seen, was published in 1769;
and he busily engaged himself in a similar office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
for his 'Natural History,' which he did not live to
complete. The emendations, however (or rather
the principal of them), appeared in the Journal of
the Royal Institution of Cornwall for 1875. And
during this latter part of his life, as well as during
the previous years, he was occupied in collecting
materials for a Parochial History of the County,
which never saw the light.</p>

<p>His last literary labour was a treatise on the
'Creation and the Deluge,' which contains some
ingenious speculations on the nature of earthquakes
and submarine upheavals. The beginning of this
little work he had actually sent to the press; but a
sudden and violent illness in 1771 warned him that
he was overtaxing his strength, and he resolved not
to go on with the publication. Within two or three
months of his death he drew up a short memoir of
his life, written in the third person, for his friend
Huddesford, which closes in the following happy
strain:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Being now in his seventy-seventh year, very little
more can be hoped for by himself or expected by
others.</p>

<p>'Having been long accustomed to the confinement
of his study, retirement and old age incessantly call
upon him with the less terrour; and resignation to
his increasing infirmities becomes every day easier
and less irksome, till at last he now accounts it
among the blessings of long life that it has quieted
and extinguished every spark of ambition, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
it enables him to withdraw more and more with some
decency from the world; precluding the perhaps
well-intended, though rather too frequent visits of
civility, in which there is generally more dissipation
at all stages of life than real compensation for the
waste of time, especially in the days of age.</p>

<p>'In hopes, however, of being not entirely useless
as yet, whilst it pleases God to grant him life, most
of his present time (as not the least of his pleasures)
he allots to the instruction of a dutiful and apprehensive
youth, the present companion of his retirement.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>So lived, and so, on the 31st August, 1772,
peacefully died, at Ludgvan, Cornwall's 'Nourice of
Antiquity,' Dr. William Borlase. He was buried
by the side of his wife, near the east end of his own
church, on the north side of the altar; and his
executor inscribed on his unpretending monument
the words:</p>

<div lang="la" xml:lang="la" class="cen">

<span class="i10">Loquuntur scripta,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">testantur posteri.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>He had six sons, only two of whom survived him,
the Rev. John Borlase and the Rev. George Borlase,
Casuistical Professor and Registrar of the University
of Cambridge. His son Christopher, a sailor, died
of a fever on the coast of Guinea in 1749, and
appears to have inherited some of his father's artistic
skill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>As an illustration of Borlase's 'method,' and of
his perfervid imagination when he got amongst his
native granite rocks, I have thought it would be
interesting to cull the following few notes from his
'Scilly Isles':</p>

<p>'On a Carn adjoining the Giant's Castle,' he
observes, 'the floor, consisting only of one Rock,
must convince us that this <em>Circle</em> was intended for
a place of Worship, for it could not serve for a
<em>Sepulchre</em>; but why the <em>Quoits</em> were hollowed out into
<em>Basons</em> (as they are placed in a <em>Religious Circle</em>) must
have been in some sort or other subservient to the
purposes of the <em>Druid Superstition</em>.' As regards the
'Rock Basons,' he goes on to say, 'My opinion concerning
the use of them you do not want to be
informed of; I have always thought that they were
designed to receive in their utmost purity the waters
of the Heavens for holy uses; but in such doubtful
cases let every man think for himself.' A little
further on, however, the worthy Doctor's theory as
to the extreme purity of the water is somewhat disturbed
by his finding some of them inconveniently
near the sea; but he is equal to the occasion.
'Though,' he says, 'the spray of the sea so near
them on every hand might well be supposed to fill
these Basons with salt water, yet I found the water
in them to be quite fresh.' Some of these were
actually under the sea-level!</p>

<p>In another place, writing of tolmens, the Doctor
observes that, though their Cornish name, appropriately
enough, signifies a holed stone, yet that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
not 'the true Druid name ... for the Druids
<em>probably</em> call'd it by the name of one of their Deities
as soon as it was ritually consecrated, and most
likely by that of <em>Saturn</em>.'</p>

<p>He is in doubt whether the furrows which he
noticed on certain rocks were channels on the sites
of the holy fires of the Druids, made in order to
enable the priests the better to collect the sacred
embers, or whether they were designed to collect the
blood of sacrificed victims for the purposes of divination.
But he admits ''tis all mere conjecture.'</p>

<p>And again&mdash;a 'canopy rock' with a row of rude
stone pillars before it is a 'Druid Seat of Judgment';&mdash;in
fact, on Borlase's theory, the whole of the
Scilly Isles must have been thickly peopled with
Druids.</p>

<p>But as the writer in the <cite>Quarterly</cite> truly observes,
'The Druids have of late years been somewhat
rudely dismissed from the shade of their accustomed
oaks, and the rock-basons have been proved to be
simply the result of the weathering of the granite.'</p>

<p class="drop-capi2"><span class="smcap">A novel</span>
 feature presents itself in this
case to the would-be historian which
does not appear, at least to so great an
extent, in the cases of certain other
distinguished Cornish families. The Killigrews, the
Arundells, the Godolphins, and the Grenvilles, for
instance, all yielded more than one man of mark
deserving of special notice; but this can hardly be
said of the family of Boscawen: the interest centres
in Admiral the Honourable Edward Boscawen,
almost to the exclusion of all his ancestors, and of
all his descendants. And he affords another instance,
like Opie, of being doubly secure of a niche in the
temple of Fame, from his own distinguished career,
as well as through the wit and distinguished social
qualities of his wife; who, the writer regrets to add,
was not&mdash;as the majority of her husband's ancestresses,
and as those of most distinguished Cornishmen
were&mdash;a Cornish-woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>It would probably be of little use now to speculate
upon the causes why the Boscawens, for at least
five centuries, continued to hold a well-recognised
position in the county, acquiring by their judicious
marriages into wealthy families vast landed interests
in various parts of Cornwall, but chiefly in the
vicinities of Buryan and Tregothnan and in the
north-western part of the county, doubtless holding
their own amongst their fellows, and doing what the
world would call their 'duty;' and yet contributing,
so far as I can ascertain, scarcely one person whose
name is to be found in the usual records of English
history until we reach the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Yet it must be noted that the Boscawens are of
very old standing in Cornwall. Hals indeed tells us
that the first Boscawen who settled in Cornwall was
an Irish gentleman;&mdash;and Hals may be right; for he
had peculiar facilities for learning the early traditions
of the family from the neighbourhood of Fentongollan
(the seat of the Halses) to Tregothnan, the
seat of the Boscawens; and also from the fact that
one member of the family 'Hugh Boscawen, Gent.,
Master of Arts,' as a labour of love, taught young
Hals, and many other youngsters, all that they
knew of Latin and Greek in an old school-house
in St. Michael Penkivel Church.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Nor was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Master of Arts the only member of the family who
dispensed information free of charge; for Hals tells
us of a Charles Boscawen of Nansavallan who was
a barrister-at-law, 'and who made noe further use
thereof in his elder years then to councill and assist
his friends in all their lawe concerns gratis.' He
died in London, without issue; and was Member of
Parliament for Truro,&mdash;an ancient borough, with
which, as we shall see, the Boscawens were intimately
connected.</p>

<p>At Boscawen Rose, in the parish of St. Buryan,
within a few miles of the Land's End, where the
name is still found attached to places in the parish,
the first Boscawen is said to have exchanged his
Irish patronymic for that of the place where he
took up his abode, and which was probably well
enough described by its Cornish name, which signifies
the Valley of Elder-trees. It is interesting to
notice how many of these trees (much esteemed by
the old Cornish folk), and almost these alone, still
are to be found near the wind-whipped shores of the
Land's End.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>I find no record of the marriages of the first two or
three generations; but in the reign of Edward I.
(about 1292), Henry de Boscawen married Hawise
Trewoof; and some half century later (1335) John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
de Boscawen married an heiress, Joan de Tregothnan,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
thus establishing a connexion between
those two names, which has ever since been maintained;
for Tregothnan, 'the place of well-wooded
valleys,' is still the family seat: it is now the Cornish
residence of Evelyn Boscawen, sixth Viscount
Falmouth. The present house, a handsome structure,
was built by the architect, W. Wilkins, jun.,
about the year 1815, replacing a more picturesque
but smaller and less commodious building.</p>

<p>Intimate relations with the exquisitely wooded
banks of the Fal were still further established by
the marriage of the son of the aforesaid John
Boscawen of Tregothnan with another heiress,
named Joan, like his mother, who brought her
husband the wealth of the family of Albalanda or
Blanchland, in the parish of Kea, on the opposite
side of the river to Tregothnan; a place where,
according to Lysons, copper was first successfully
worked in Cornwall. And, while on this subject, it
seems not unworthy of remark that the alliances
of the Boscawens and the Albalandas with the
families who resided on the Fal and its tributaries
were numerous. Rose Albalanda married a William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Dangrous of Carclew, in the fifth year of Edward
III.; and the heiress of Trenowith, who married
Hugh Boscawen, a great grandson of the first-named
John, was herself the descendant of ancestors
called after Tolverne, Trewarthenick and Tregarrick&mdash;names
which still belong to places on the shores
of the river, or hard by. Nor did the Boscawens
neglect to cultivate acquaintance and to intermarry
with other Cornish families who made more noise
in the world than those to whom we have been
referring; for they and the Albalandas also married
with Arundell, Bassett, St. Aubyn, Lower, Godolphin,
Carminow, and Trevanion.</p>

<p>He who married Elizabeth St. Aubyn for his first
wife was one Richard Boscawen, who paid a fine of
five pounds rather than undergo the expensive ceremony
of being made a Knight of the Bath at the
coronation of Henry VII., possibly because he was
an old man, and dreaded a long journey to the
metropolis, for he died four years afterwards, in 1489.
His grandson, Hugh, who by the way married
Phelip, a daughter of the fine old Cornish family of
Carminow, now extinct, paid a similar fine of four
marks at the coronation of Queen Mary; for what
reason I know not. In the 'Bayliff of Blackmore'
there is a long story of his being outwitted by a
family in Truro; but the course pursued by these
Boscawens, as narrated in that curious MS., was not
unusual in those days. With the great-grandson
of the last-named Hugh, himself bearing the same
Christian name, commences, so far as I am aware,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
a more particular connexion of the family with the
ancient borough, now the city, of Truro, where the
principal street (formerly two streets, then bearing
other names, but now thrown into one) is still called
after them, 'Boscawen.' He was chosen Knight of
the Shire for Cornwall in 1626; and Edward, his fifth
son, who represented Tregony in Parliament, was one
of the leading members of the House of Commons,
temp. Charles II. This Hugh, who was 'Chief of
the Coat Armour' at the Heralds' Visitation of Cornwall
in 1620, was likewise in that year Recorder of
the Borough. He had three sons: Hugh,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> of whom
nothing seems to be known except that he married
a Clinton; Edward, a rich Turkey merchant, who
was a Member of Parliament, temp. Charles II.,
and died at Trefusis, a lovely place overlooking the
waters of Falmouth Harbour; and Nicholas, who
joined the Parliamentary army (a rare thing, by the
way, for a Cornish gentleman to do) with a troop
raised from among his own tenantry. But the
military career of Nicholas Boscawen (how terminated
I have not been able to ascertain) must have
been a short one; for, when only twenty-two years of
age and unmarried, he was buried in Westminster
Abbey, whence his remains were removed some fifteen
years afterwards, at the Restoration, to be flung into
a common pit in St. Margaret's churchyard.</p>

<p>We now approach that part of the family history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
when the individual members cannot be quite so
rapidly dismissed from notice.</p>

<p>The only son of Edward Boscawen (the Turkey
merchant) and Jael Godolphin was another Hugh;
who, like his father and uncles, seems to have been no
friend to the Stuarts, and to have assisted in bringing
to England William III. This no doubt explains his
being made Captain of St. Mawes Castle, Warden
of the Stannaries, Steward of the Duchy of Cornwall
in the room of Francis Godolphin, Viscount Rialton;
Comptroller of the Household; a Privy Councillor;
and finally, in 1720, his being ennobled by the titles of
Baron Boscawen Rose and Viscount Falmouth. He
was also Vice-Treasurer of Ireland, a post which he
resigned the year of his death. He several times,
before gaining his title, sat for Cornwall in Parliament;
but gave up all his appointments except that of
Warden of the Stannaries, on the defeat of the
Excise Scheme.</p>

<p>Hugh Boscawen seems to have been quite carried
away by his political zeal, for he was foremost in
arresting, or trying to arrest, any, even of his old
friends, who were suspected of holding high monarchical
principles; amongst whom may be named Sir
Richard Vyvyan, of Trelowarren, and, as we have
already seen,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Mr. Basset, of Tehidy. He died of an
apoplexy, at Trefusis, in 1734, having married, in
1700, Charlotte Godfrey, a niece of the great Duke of
Marlborough, by whom he had eighteen children,
eight sons and ten daughters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>The second Viscount of the same name seems,
though of a kind and gentle disposition, not to have
possessed a very brilliant intellect. Davies Gilbert
tells the story of him that he is said to have mistaken
the phrase, 'Optat ephippia <em>Bos</em>,' for the Latin of
his own name; and that he always confounded
Horace Walpole with the Roman poet whose name
is so familiar to us. Probably a somewhat unattractive
sort of man, for his wife often threatened, so
Mrs. Delany says, that she 'wou'd part with my lord.'</p>

<p>Yet he was not without shrewdness, and had
some political influence. Votes which overthrew Sir
Robert Walpole were carried against the Minister
by his losing the majority of the Scotch and Cornish
boroughs; the latter of which were managed by
Lord Falmouth and Thomas Pitt. Indeed, the
second Viscount Falmouth, like so many others of
his contemporaries, was a great dealer in boroughs.
It is of him that Dodington tells the story, that he
went to the Minister to ask him a favour, which
the latter seemed unwilling to grant; upon which
Lord Falmouth said, 'Remember, sir, <em>we</em> are <em>seven</em>!'
And Dover says that Lord Cowper resigned the
Bedchamber on the 'Beefeaters' being given to Lord
Falmouth:&mdash;'The latter, who is powerful in elections,
insisted on having it; the other had nothing but a
promise from the King, which the Ministry had
already twice forced him to break.'</p>

<p>He was also Yeoman of the Guard to George II.,
and in 1745, according to Chauncey, raised a regiment
at his own expense to serve against the Scotch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
rebels; and he had such influence in Cornwall that
6,387 persons joined an association, the members
of which bound themselves to appear armed in
the best manner they could, under his command,
to defend the King and the Government. Mrs.
Thomson, in her 'Memoirs of Viscountess Sandon,'
tells us how the second Viscount's wife, H. C. M.
Russell, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">née</i> Smith, was in desperate straits to get
herself appointed a Lady of the Bedchamber, and
wrote the most pressing letters to Mrs. Clayton on
the subject. In one she says that she could not sleep
a wink all night for thinking of it!</p>

<p>His brother Nicholas went to Corpus Christi
College, Cambridge, took holy orders, and on the
Duke of Newcastle's visit to the University, as Chancellor,
was created a D.D. He was appointed a
King's Chaplain, and 'Dean' of Buryan in 1756,
Rector of St. Mabyn and of St. Michael Penkivel in
1774, and a Prebendary of Westminster in 1777. The
only remarkable thing about him seems to have been
his appointment as 'Dean' of Buryan, the exact
significance of which dignity it is difficult to discover,
though it is said that this 'Deanery' had jurisdiction
over three parishes, and the probate of wills therein,
and that there were three prebends attached to it; it
is not uninteresting to note this tendency in a member
of the Boscawen family to 'hark back to their early
St. Buryan haunts.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> His wife, Mrs. Hatton, was, I
believe, the widow of a linendraper in Newgate Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>There was another brother, John&mdash;a Major-General
in the army;&mdash;and the 4th son of the second Viscount,
the Hon. George Boscawen, was another military
member of the family; he was present at the battles
of Dettingen and Fontenoy, and represented Truro
in Parliament from 1761 to 1764. His daughter,
Mary, maid-of-honour to the Princess Charlotte,
wrote a memoir of the Princess.</p>

<p>William Boscawen, younger son of the above
General George Boscawen, was educated at Eton,
where he became a great favourite of Dr. Barnard.
He became a Gentleman Commoner of Exeter College,
and on settling in London studied law under a
Cornish lawyer, Mr. Justice Buller, about 1770, and
went the Western Circuit. William Boscawen does
not appear to have taken his degree at Oxford; but
Wordsworth, in his 'Scholæ Academicæ,' points
out that it was not unusual during the last century,
and at the commencement of the present, for gentlemen
intending for the law to leave the University
without taking a degree. He published two or three
law treatises, was a Commissioner in Bankruptcy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
and in 1785 he was made a Commissioner of the
Victualling Office. By his marriage with Charlotte
Ibbetson he had five daughters. He was much
attached to literary pursuits, and translated, first
the 'Odes,' 'Epodes,' and 'Carmen Seculare' of
Horace, then the 'Satires,' 'Epistles,' and 'Art of
Poetry;'&mdash;and in many respects his translation was
considered superior to Francis's. He was much indebted
for his 'notes' to Dr. Foster, of Eton College.
In 1801, he published some original poems and other
works. A friend who met him in the Strand a few
days before his death noticed that he was looking very
ill; and on the 8th May, 1811, he died of asthma, at
Little Chelsea. He was of an affectionate and benevolent
disposition; and the Literary Fund he considered
almost as his own child, writing the annual
verses for it till within five years of his death.</p>

<p>A contemporary critic says of his literary productions,
that if in them 'he does not take a lead among
his contemporaries, he at least discovers an elegant
taste, a poetical mind, and a correct versification.'
'Could his character be truly drawn, it would exhibit
a consummate picture of everything that is amiable
and estimable in human nature.' 'Incapable of <em>being</em>
an enemy, it was never known that he had one; and
his friends were as numerous as his virtues.'</p>

<p>As a specimen of his powers as a translator, his
rendering of the well-known fifth ode of the 1st Book
of Horace, will, I venture to think, compare, not
altogether unfavourably, with the productions of his
mightier predecessors in the task&mdash;Milton and Cowley.</p>

<p>But a third brother of the second Viscount&mdash;Edward,
the Admiral&mdash;was destined to live in the
pages of history; and of him I propose to treat more
at length at the conclusion of this brief sketch of the
family generally, which now draws rapidly to a close.</p>

<p>George Evelyn, the Admiral's youngest son, was
the third Viscount, issue having failed through his
two uncles, and George Evelyn's brothers having
died before the death of their uncle, the second
Viscount. Of these brothers it may be observed,
that Edward Hugh,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> the eldest, who was M.P.
for Truro, died abroad in 1774; and that William
Glanville, a youth of great promise, and an officer in
the navy, was drowned when eighteen years of age,
in 1769, whilst bathing at Port Royal, Jamaica. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
him, said Mrs. Delany, 'his father's (the Admiral's)
merit revived,' and he was 'the delight and glory of
the lives of his mother and sisters.' I hardly know
whether the following lines on his death are from
Mrs. Delany's pen, or from his mother's:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ah, William! till thy hapless hour<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall fade on mem'ry's pensive eye<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For thee shall Virtue drop the tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Honour's envied praise be thine.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There can, however, be little doubt that it was a
mother's pen which described him, on his cenotaph,
as that 'most lovely, most beloved youth.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But to return to the surviving and youngest
brother, George Evelyn, who was destined to perpetuate
the title. He is said to have been very like
his mother, who describes herself as 'a little personage;'
and he must have inherited the talents of
both his parents, for he did remarkably well at
Winchester, and very early showed a determination
to follow in his illustrious father's footsteps by fighting
against the enemies of his country, notwithstanding
the wishes of his family to the contrary.
For the sum of £400 his mother at last unwillingly
procured for her 'poor little soldier,' as she termed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
him, an ensigncy in the 4th or King's Own Regiment
of Foot; and he, proceeding forthwith to America,
was soon after present at the battle of Lexington.
When Prince William Henry, afterwards William IV.,
came into Falmouth harbour in the <i>Hebe</i> in 1785, he
was entertained at Tregothnan, and thence, under
Viscount Falmouth's guidance, visited all the Cornish
'lions.' On 25th October, 1787, Mrs. Boscawen
writes thus to Mrs. Delany: 'My son has been a
peacemaker in Cornwall, and was happy enough to
pacify near a thousand angry miners, who were
marching into Truro to pull their houses about their
ears;' and here it may be noted that one of his
ancestors had performed a similar valuable public
service when the Hon. Hugh Boscawen, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text 'Lord-Warden'">Lord Warden</ins>
of the Stannaries of Cornwall and Devon,
presided over the Convocation of the twenty-four
Stannators, 20th February to 20th April, 1710, held in
the Coinage Hall, Truro; on which occasion, by a
judicious speech, he dispersed a mob of some 5,000
or 6,000 men, tinners and others, led by one Charles
Tregea, who had assembled to intimidate the Convocation,
and 'force them to a farm.' The object of
this Convocation was 'to keep up the price of tin,
and to confirm the laws, customs, and constitutions
of the Stannaries;' but it led to no satisfactory result.</p>

<p>The third Viscount's two sisters married well&mdash;one,
Frances, gained for her husband the Hon. John
Leveson Gower, Secretary to the Admiralty; and the
other, Elizabeth, secured Henry, fifth Duke of
Beaufort&mdash;an affair which does not seem to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
altogether satisfied that family. Her mother writes
to Mrs. Delany, that the Beauforts were not particularly
well pleased with the match;&mdash;'And yet,
my dear madam,' says the sprightly Admiral's
widow, 'does not Admiral Boscawen's daughter,
with £10,000 now, and at least 5 (<em>i.e.</em> £5,000) more
by-and-by, with many excellent wife-like qualities,
and no faults that ever they heard of, deserve some
gentler welcome, <em>especially as nobody asks anything of
them</em>?' The Duke seems to have made the Cornish
lassie a most devoted and affectionate husband.</p>

<p>George Evelyn Boscawen was succeeded in the title
by his son, Edward, fourth Viscount and first Earl
of Falmouth. He was an officer in the Coldstream
Guards, and, like so many other members of his family,
Recorder of Truro&mdash;the last who filled that office.
He was the second of Lord Winchelsea in his
famous duel with the Duke of Wellington, fought
on Wimbledon Common in March, 1829, when the
Duke fired and missed, and Lord Winchelsea then
fired in the air and apologized. This nobleman rebuilt
Tregothnan House, near the site of an older and
picturesque mansion, in which might have been seen
many carved stones from the old tower and chapel
at Fentongollan; and he made the famous drive to it
from Tresilian Bridge, an undertaking the result of
which he is said to have always contemplated with
much satisfaction. His son, George Henry, fifth
Viscount, and second and last Earl, died unmarried in
1852, fourteen years after his father. He was a
man of considerable ability, taking, in 1832, a first-class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
at Oxford; and he was one of the best amateur
violinists of his day. As we have said, with him
the earldom lapsed. His cousin Evelyn succeeded
him as sixth Viscount, and has been one of the
most distinguished patrons of the turf, as well as a
most fortunate owner of race-horses, having, as I
am informed, won the Derby, the St. Leger, and the
Two Thousand Guineas twice, and the Oaks and the
One Thousand Guineas four times each; besides
other important races.</p>

<p class="center pxx">'A great Admiral.'<br />
<span class="smcap"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pitt.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">The foregoing sketch of the history of the Boscawens
seemed desirable in order to give the reader
some idea of the sources from which Pitt's 'great
Admiral' sprang, and to serve as a background to
the family picture in which his figure is the most
prominent. We have seen that the Boscawens
were an ancient, wealthy, and not altogether undistinguished
group of Cornishmen; and have noted
that their seat had for ages been on the banks of that
sylvan river which empties its waters into the once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
renowned Falmouth Haven. Here Edward Boscawen,
third son of the first Viscount, was born on
the 19th August, 1711; and, notwithstanding the
absence (so far as I am aware) of any published
details concerning the childhood and youth of the
illustrious sailor, except the fact of his quaint humour
in imitating the gestures of an old servant till he
himself contracted a constant habit of carrying his
head slightly on one side<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>&mdash;there can be little doubt,
I think, that a good deal of the young sea-dog's
leisure was spent on, or in, the Fal, which washes
the shores of his ancestral woods and glades.
We know, indeed, that he entered the navy whilst
<em>very young</em> (when only twelve years old, so Campbell
says), and this suggests the idea that the future 'old
Dreadnought' may have found the limits of the
sequestered Tregothnan estate and the quiet life led
there incompatible with the high spirits which a lad
of his quality must undoubtedly have possessed. In
other words, we can but believe that he was a born
sailor, and that he merited, from the first, another of
his sobriquets,&mdash;derived from the heroic contempt of
danger which he manifested throughout his life&mdash;'the
brave Boscawen.' He no doubt expected that,
in accordance with the practice of a century and a
half ago, through family interest he would very
shortly obtain his lieutenancy, when an order was
suddenly and unexpectedly issued, subjecting all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
midshipmen to at least six years' service. 'To this
order,' Boscawen used to say, 'I owe all my knowledge
of seamanship.' At any rate, the new regulation
did not change his views, nor prevent many
other Cornish youngsters from entering the navy
and serving under an officer who was as fond of
having them about him as they were of sailing under
his command. Amongst such may be named the
Hon. George Edgcumbe,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> afterwards Admiral of
the White, who commanded the <i>Lancaster</i> of seventy
guns at the famous siege of Louisbourg (of which
we shall hear more by-and-by); and Admiral Sir
Richard Spry, who commanded a similar ship, the
<i>Oxford</i>, on that occasion.</p>

<p>And here it should be remembered how different
in many respects is the position of the modern
British sailor&mdash;true Briton as he still is, and is
proving himself to be at Alexandria even whilst I
write these lines&mdash;from the traditional sailor of
Boscawen's days. Now, most of the sailors' work
in our steam iron-clads is done on deck or below;
but, at the period of which we are about to consider
some episodes, the larger proportion&mdash;certainly the
more difficult&mdash;was performed aloft. In weather of
all sorts 'there were dead-eyes to turn in, there were
chafing gear to look after, reef-points to knot, masts to
stay, studding-sail gear to reeve, and the like.' Then
the wild excitement of going aloft to shorten sail in
stormy weather! The old songs at the reef-tackles,
the flapping of the canvas, the springing into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
shrouds, and the helter-skelter race for the weather-earing&mdash;unless,
indeed, the iron-hard pressure of the
gale pinned you against the shrouds as if you had
been a spread-eagle. In work of this sort the
English tars were always pre-eminent, and one
can easily believe that the Admiral accordingly had
a thoroughly hearty contempt for the unsailor-like
character of the French crews. Of one he said
he 'never saw so bad a crew on salt water before;
there were not twenty men on board who could go
aloft.'<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Those, too, were days not only of rough
work, but also of rough-and-ready fighting; and
Boscawen's motto, like that of Hawke,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> his illustrious
contemporary and rival, was always, 'Strike.'
One night Boscawen's lieutenant came to him, and
awoke him, saying that they had fallen in with
three ships of the enemy. 'What shall we do?'
'Why, fight 'em, to be sure!' said Boscawen; and,
dashing up on deck in his night shirt, he soon compelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>the enemy to sheer off. It was from this
action that he is said to have acquired the name of
Old Dreadnought. On another occasion he took
off his wig, and with it stopped a leak in his boat,
which was rapidly sinking.</p>

<p>As we have seen, he was the third son of the first
Viscount Falmouth, and was called Edward after his
grandfather. His grandmother, Jael, was of the fine
old Cornish stock of Godolphin, and his mother
was Charlotte Godfrey, a niece of the great Duke of
Marlborough, not a natural daughter (as Hals says)
of James II., by Arabella Churchill, but her eldest
daughter, by Colonel Charles Godfrey, Master of
the Jewel Office, whom she had subsequently married;&mdash;so
that he seems to have had royal as well as
good fighting blood in his veins, some of which he
was destined to shed for his country. I do not
know at what date he received his lieutenant's commission;
probably it was on being appointed to
the <i>Hector</i> in 1732; but on the 12th March, 1737,
when not quite twenty-six years old, he was appointed
captain of the <i>Leopard</i>, a fourth-rate of
fifty guns. On the outbreak of the war with Spain,
he was transferred to the <i>Shoreham</i> of twenty guns,
and was sent to cruise off Jamaica. Unfortunately,
when Admiral Vernon determined, in November,
1740, on attacking Porto Bello (a place which
Columbus had discovered and named in 1562, and
which had once before succumbed to a British
Admiral, Sir Francis Drake, in 1596), the <i>Shoreham</i>
was found to be unfit for action; but Boscawen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
would not be deprived of this chance of seeing
some active service, so he sailed as a volunteer, and
so far distinguished himself at the easy capture of
the place&mdash;for the garrison was on a peace footing,
and the British lost only seven men&mdash;that he was
entrusted with the duty of superintending the demolition
of the fortifications.</p>

<p>Rejoining the <i>Shoreham</i>, which had now been
thoroughly overhauled, we next hear of him, in
March, 1740-41, at the siege of Carthagena, the
chief port in New Granada, again under Admiral
Vernon, who is described as a man of fair abilities,
but of harsh overbearing temper;&mdash;one of those
naval heroes of whom Byron sourly says in his 'Don
Juan:'</p>

<p class="center small">'They filled their sign-posts then like Wellesley now.'</p>

<p class="noindent">Here again he gathered laurels, and attracted considerable
notice by what Campbell describes as his
'quick-sighted judgment and intrepid valour,' commanding
a detachment of 300 sailors and 200 soldiers,
and storming a fascine battery on Boca Chica, which
had much galled General Wentworth, and held our
forces in check.</p>

<p>Campbell thus describes Boscawen's part in the
affair, which reminds us of the recent gallant rush on
Tel-el-Kebir:<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'Pushing forward with a strength equal to their
animation, they soon climbed the entrenchments,
and entering the embrasures in the face of a continued
fire, and on the very muzzles of the guns,
they drove the enemy from the works with considerable
slaughter; and after spiking the cannon and
burning the platforms, together with the gun-carriages,
guard-house, and magazine, Boscawen
led off his detachment in order, and returned to the
fleet with six wounded prisoners. The Spaniards,
fully sensible of the support which this battery had
afforded them, were indefatigable in their endeavours
to repair it; and having in a few days so far succeeded
as to be able to bring six guns to bear upon
the English fleet, Boscawen was again ordered to
reduce it, but in a manner which exposed him less to
personal danger than in the service in which it was
before deemed expedient to employ him. He was
directed to proceed with his own ship, the <i>Shoreham</i>,
together with the <i>Princess Amelia</i> and the <i>Lichfield</i>,
as close inshore as the depth of the water would
admit them (a dangerous enterprise in consequence
of the difficulties of the navigation here), to anchor
abreast of the battery, and to bring the ships' broadsides
to bear upon it; whilst, on the other hand,
a detachment of seamen, under the command of
Captains Watson, Cotes, and Dennis, were at the
same time to storm it. These measures, taken with
so much skill and prudence, would in all probability
have ensured the success of the attack; but the
Spaniards, intimidated by the formidable appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of the assailants, <em>abandoned the battery without firing a
shot</em>.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>But the place was too strongly fortified; and the
siege of Carthagena was soon after raised (a circumstance
which, by the way, tended to hasten the fall
of Walpole). Yet before Boscawen left he was again
employed, as at Porto Bello, to rase the different forts
which the English had taken on the neighbouring
coast; and, whilst engaged on this service, was
appointed to the <i>Prince Frederick</i>, of 70 guns, on
the death of Lord Aubrey Beauclerk, who gallantly
fell at Boca Chica.</p>

<p>Clinton observes that the siege lasted from January
to 24th April, 1741; and that as the surf prevented
a bombardment from the sea, it was determined to
make a lodging on Boca Chica, in order to reduce the
fort there. The long-standing jealousy between the
navy and the army was, he thinks, the cause of the
failure of the siege. However that may be, three
thousand men were lost by assaults and sickness;
and the fleet returned to Jamaica.</p>

<p>On the 14th May, 1742, Boscawen reached home,
or rather St. Helen's, Isle of Wight, bringing advices
of Admiral Vernon's having sailed on a fresh expedition,
which unfortunately proved abortive. But this
year was memorable in his life for other than warlike
exploits; for its close witnessed his marriage with
the graceful, sprightly, and accomplished Frances
Evelyn Glanville, of St. Clere, Kent; a lady sufficiently
distinguished in her day to claim, as a
Cornishman's wife, the notice which I have ventured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
to append to this sketch of the Admiral, her husband,&mdash;whose
epitaph, glowing with eloquence, she
was destined to write.</p>

<p>In the year that he married he was elected Member
for Truro. And here it may be observed that
the gallant naval officer was always extremely
popular in his native county. One account states
that he was 'positively adored' by the people, and
that they insisted on sending him to Parliament as
their representative, notwithstanding his reluctance
to serve, on account of one member of his family
being already there&mdash;namely, his father&mdash;in the
House of Peers. Again, in 1747 he was elected for
both Saltash (another old Cornish borough) and
Truro; but he decided on maintaining his political
connexion with the latter.</p>

<p>The next few months of his life would seem to
have passed without any events of public interest
occurring; but, early in 1744, war, arising out of the
assistance given by the French to the Young Pretender's
ill-starred descent upon England, broke out
with France; and Boscawen was made Captain of
the <i>Dreadnought</i>, of 60 guns. With her he very soon
after captured the <i>Medea</i>, a French frigate of 26 guns
and 240 men, commanded by a M. Hocquart&mdash;whom
in the course of our history we shall twice meet
again as Boscawen's prisoner. This was the first
prize taken in the war. For some time he continued
doing what may be called home duty&mdash;cruising in
the Channel, sitting on courts-martial, and acting
as Commodore on board the <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Nore. Whilst acting in the latter capacity it fell
within his province to send out several of the newly-pressed
men as they were brought to him in company
with some experienced seamen, in frigates and
small vessels, to guard the mouths of many of the
minor creeks and rivers along the shores of Kent
and Sussex.</p>

<p>In January, 1746, he was appointed to the <i>Namur</i>,
formerly of 90 guns, but afterwards reduced to a
third-rate; and in November of that year, being
in command of a small squadron at the mouth of the
Channel, he captured two prizes&mdash;one a large privateer
from St. Malo, the other a despatch-boat from
M. De Jonquiere (the commander of the French
fleet on the American station), with advices of the
death of the Duc D'Anville, and of the consequent
failure of the expedition under that officer's command.</p>

<p>We now approach the time when he was to receive
his first wound of consequence, and to perform
one of the most gallant and self-denying exploits of
his brave career&mdash;a deed so daring and so brilliantly
successful as to excite the jealousy of Anson, his
superior officer, and thus to lay the foundation of an
ill-feeling between those two gallant seamen which, it
is to be feared, can be traced throughout their lives.</p>

<p>In 1747, whilst commanding a line-of-battle ship
in the fleet intended for America, under Admirals
Anson and Vernon, he was present at the gallant
action of the 3rd May, off Cape Finisterre. 'Here,'
says Campbell, 'Boscawen signalized himself equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
by his heroism and his judgment. The French
fleet, having got the weather-gage, kept up a constant
and well-directed fire on the English ships as
they turned to windward to form the line abreast
of the enemy. But Boscawen, perceiving that our
ships would thereby be disabled before their guns
could be brought to bear upon the French line, and
his ship being a very superior sailer to any of the
rest, and being, besides, the leading ship of the van,
pressed forward with a crowd of sail, received himself
the greatest part of the enemy's fire, and singly
maintained the conflict until the remainder of the
fleet came up to his support; by which daring but
judicious manœuvre <em>he principally contributed</em> to the
success with which on that day the British arms
were crowned.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> On this occasion he was severely
wounded in the shoulder by a musket-ball. His
country, however, was not long deprived of his
services by this misfortune, from the effects of which
he recovered in a few weeks.' At Finisterre all
the French ships, ten in number, were taken, including
the <i>Diamant</i>, of 56 tons, commanded by M.
Hocquart, who thus became, for the second time,
Boscawen's prisoner.</p>

<p>Shortly after being made Rear-Admiral of the
Blue, he was invested with a command which shows
the remarkable estimation in which he was held by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Government, receiving, as he did, a commission from
the King as Admiral and Commandant of a squadron
of six ships of the line and five frigates, with 2,000
soldiers on board, ordered for the East Indies; and
also as General and Commander-in-Chief of the land
forces employed in the expedition&mdash;'the only instance,
except that of the Earl of Peterborough, of
any officer having received such a command since
the reign of Charles II.' Yet, such were his tact
and personal character, that no ill-feeling arose on
the part of the troops thus placed under his command&mdash;in
fact, as an officer, quoted by Campbell,
quaintly says, 'the Admiral, by his genteel behaviour,
gained the love of the land officers, and
never was greater harmony among all degrees of
men than in this expedition;' notwithstanding which
it failed in effecting the main objects which it had in
view, viz. the capture of Pondicherry, and the attack
on Port Louis, Mauritius, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> thither. He sailed
from St. Helen's on the 4th November, 1747; but
owing to bad weather and contrary winds, did not
reach the Cape of Good Hope till the 29th March,
1748; and here he remained a short time to refresh
his jaded crews.</p>

<p>The difficulties of the landing at Port Louis, and
the strength of the batteries by which it was defended,
were such as to triumph over even the genius
and courage of Boscawen; and after vain though
most strenuous search for a practicable landing-place,
the Admiral called a council of war, at which it was
determined that a small boat-party should land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
during the night with a view to capturing (if possible)
at least one man of the enemy, from whom they
might obtain information as to the numbers and
situation of the French forces. This ingenious
attempt, however, failed; and at a second council of
war it was agreed that the attack on Port Louis,
even if it succeeded (which was doubtful), would
necessitate the leaving behind so large a force to
occupy the place, that it would imperil the chances of
capturing Pondicherry, the principal object of the expedition;
and to this it may be added that Boscawen
had lost many of his men from their eating a poisonous
fish called the vieille, at the island of Roderique.</p>

<p>They accordingly sailed at once for Fort St. David,
near Pondicherry, which place they reached on the
29th July; and here Boscawen took over the command,
from Admiral Griffin, of what had now become
the largest 'marine force belonging to any one
European nation that had ever been seen in the
Indian seas.' Boscawen marched forward with his
army on the 8th of August, and opened the trenches
on the 27th. But his men rapidly grew sick in that unwholesome
climate; his chief engineer was killed; the
monsoons were shortly expected. It was found that
the garrison far outnumbered the besiegers, and,
'everything having been done which gallantry and
perseverance could perform,' writes Walpole, on
the 6th October it was finally determined to raise
the siege.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> And a gale, on 14th April, 1749, arose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
which seems to have been the main cause of the unsuccessful
termination of the whole expedition&mdash;the
Admiral's flag-ship, the <i>Namur</i>, foundered; the
<i>Pembroke</i> and the <i>Apollo</i> (hospital ship) were also
lost, together with a very large proportion of their
crews. Providentially, our Admiral and General
was on shore at the time.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards peace was declared at Aix-la-Chapelle,
and Boscawen had, at least, the gratification
of having Madras delivered up to him.</p>

<p>In April, 1750, he returned to England in the
<i>Exeter</i>, to find that during his absence he had been
appointed Rear-Admiral of the White; and additional
honours soon after fell to his lot. In 1751 he
was made a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty,
and at the Board's meetings found many opportunities
of falling foul of his old foe, Anson, whom
he always suspected, perhaps without sufficient
cause, of having sent him on what the former knew
from the beginning would be the fruitless expedition
to Pondicherry. This suspicion, however, would
seem to be confirmed by a letter from Walpole to
Mann, dated 31st January, 1750, in which the writer
says that Boscawen was unfortunate during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
whole expedition (East Indies), and that Anson sent
him upon it 'on purpose to ruin him  ... upon slight
intelligence, and upon improbable views.' A jealousy,
as we have seen, had previously arisen between the
two Admirals over the Cape Finisterre affair, when
Boscawen complained loudly of Anson's behaviour.
In July, 1751, he was made an Elder Brother of
the Trinity House; and in May, 1754, he was, for
the third time, chosen to represent in the House of
Commons his old borough of Truro, between which
and himself there had existed so long and friendly a
connexion;&mdash;and now, 'for want of something better
to do,' as one of his biographers insinuates, he
became a zealous politician.</p>

<p>In 1755 he was made Vice-Admiral of the Blue;
and, the French beginning to display ambitious
projects in America, Boscawen was despatched from
Spithead on 19th April, with a strong fleet, to
frustrate their designs. The French Admiral was
M. Bois de la Motte, and he had a large and powerful
armament of twenty-five ships of the line, and other
vessels, together with a train of artillery, etc., etc.
Boscawen's force consisted of eleven sail and a frigate,
together with two regiments of infantry. He was,
however, afterwards reinforced by six ships of the
line and another frigate under the command of Rear-Admiral
Holbourne. The English ships waited for
the Frenchmen off Cape Ray, Newfoundland; but in
a fog the French Admiral eluded his antagonists,
and contrived to get his ships (with two exceptions)
into harbour. These two ships Boscawen captured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
on the 10th June, after a gallant engagement
of five hours. They contained £80,000 in specie, a
large number of French officers, and altogether
1,500 prisoners. The two French ships were the
<i>Alcide</i> and <i>Lys</i> (each of 64 guns), which were taken
by the <i>Defiance</i> and the <i>Dunkirk</i>. Again Boscawen
took the first French ships during the war; and
again found his old acquaintance, M. Hocquart, on
board one of them, who thus for the third time
became the British Admiral's prisoner of war. The
story of the action is thus graphically told by Lord
Mahon:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Only the day before King George III. embarked
at Harwich (for his usual summer residence at his
beloved Hanover, notwithstanding the strong feeling
which existed against his leaving the kingdom at so
critical a time) Admiral Boscawen, with eleven ships
of the line and two regiments on board, set sail from
Portsmouth. His orders were to follow a large
French armament which had recently been equipped
at Brest, and to attack it if designed for the Bay of
St. Lawrence. A thick fog off Newfoundland concealed
the rival fleets from each other; but two
English ships, the first commanded by Captain
(afterwards Lord) Howe, came within speech of two
French ships. The foreign commandant inquired if
it was war or peace. Howe replied that he must
wait for his Admiral's signal, but that he advised
the Frenchman to prepare for war. Ere long appeared
Boscawen's signal for engaging; Howe
attacked, and after an engagement, in which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
displayed equal skill and intrepidity, succeeded in
taking the two French ships&mdash;the <i>Alcide</i> and the <i>Lys</i>.
The rest of the French armament&mdash;eight or nine
ships of the line&mdash;got safe into the harbour of
Louisbourg; and their safety caused as great disappointment
in England as the capture of their
consorts irritation in France. The French Ambassador
in London, M. de Mirepoix, was recalled at
these tidings, yet still there was not on either side a
formal declaration of war.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>On the 15th November, Boscawen returned to
England with his prizes and his prisoners, and
anchored at Spithead.</p>

<p>In the following year, 1756, he commanded the
squadron in the Bay of Quiberon, stationed there
for the purpose of watching the French fleet; but,
so far as I am aware, was engaged in no important
active service on that occasion. His leisure, however,
gave him an opportunity of showing the
interest he took in the welfare of his men, as well as
his resource in alleviating the tedium of their unoccupied
time, by setting them to work to cultivate a
barren island, and converting it into a fruitful garden,
whose produce was an extremely welcome adjunct
to the invariable salt junk and biscuit of those days.
Promotions, however, came, and he was made, at
short intervals, successively Vice-Admiral of the
White and of the Red.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the year 1758 proved more eventful for our
hero; and is perhaps the most memorable in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
annals, for it witnessed his gallant attack and capture
of Louisbourg&mdash;'once mistress of the seas,' and 'the
key to French America,' but now consisting of a
few fishermen's huts and some moss-covered ruins.
This event directly led to the conquest of Canada.</p>

<p>On the 28th of May, being now full Admiral, he
sailed from his old starting-point, St. Helen's. And
here it may be well, in order to understand the importance
of the service on which Boscawen was now
engaged, to take a rapid glance at the general
position of affairs.</p>

<p>In 1758 there was war in each of the four
quarters of the globe. England was triumphing
over the Gallic power in India, and over its settlements
on the western shores of Africa. And Pitt,
having decided on dealing a blow at the French in
North America, planned an expedition for the conquest
of Cape Breton and St. John's. Disregarding
the old principles of selecting for the command
officers whose chief recommendation was their
family connexions or their political influence, he
selected General (afterwards Lord) Amherst to command
the army, and Boscawen to be the head of
the fleet. The armament (says Lord Mahon)
assembled at Halifax, and consisted of 150 sail and
12,000 soldiers. On 2nd June it came to anchor
within seven miles of Louisbourg, the capital of
Cape Breton. The land-defences of this place had
been carefully strengthened by the French, in
expectation of the attack; five ships of the line
were drawn up in the harbour, and the garrison,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
soldiers and marines together, exceeded 6,000 men.
It was with much difficulty, and after stout resistance,
that the English effected their landing. Wolfe (who
had attracted Pitt's notice by his behaviour before
Rochefort) was the first to spring from the boats
into the raging surf, and cheer on his soldiers to the
charge. During the whole siege his ardour and
activity were equally conspicuous.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The conduct
of General Amherst also deserves high praise; and
the most cordial co-operation&mdash;another proof how
judiciously the chiefs had been chosen&mdash;prevailed
between himself and Admiral Boscawen. For the
besieged, they kept up their fire with much spirit,
and attempted several sallies; but before the close
of July, many of their cannon being dismounted,
and divers practicable breaches made in the walls,
they were compelled to capitulate. The garrison
became prisoners of war, and were transported to
England. Besides the ships captured in the harbour,
a large amount of stores and ammunition was found
in the place. Wolfe was on this occasion second
in command to Amherst; and Clinton, too, notes that
'for almost the first time in a mixed expedition
there was perfect accord between all ranks of both
services: Boscawen, Amherst, and Wolfe concerted
all measures without jealousy, and an eye-witness
records that "the soldiers worked like horses, making
the roads, and drawing up the cannon, while the
sailors went and lent a hand to build up the
batteries."' The whole island of Cape Breton submitted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
on the fall of its capital; and the island of St.
John's followed the fate of Cape Breton, being
occupied by Colonel Lord Rollo with a detachment
of troops. Eleven pairs of French colours taken
during the siege were, by his Majesty's command,
carried in procession, with kettle-drums and
trumpets sounding, from Kensington Palace to St.
Paul's Cathedral, and deposited there amidst a
salute of cannon and other public demonstrations
of triumph. They were received by the Dean and
Chapter, and put up near the west door of the
Cathedral, whilst the guns of the Tower and St.
James's Park thundered out their victorious
salutes. Sir Henry Ellis, in his edition (1818) of
Dugdale's 'St. Paul's,' says that, of the flags and
banners hung inside the nave and round the dome,
the oldest were those taken at Louisbourg. Nor
were the rejoicings confined to London; a great
number of other towns and corporations lighted
bonfires in the streets, and sent addresses of congratulation
to the King; and a form of prayer and
thanksgiving for the victory was read in all the
churches in England.</p>

<p>Among the many brilliant exploits of the British
navy during the year 1758&mdash;during which period we
captured or destroyed 16 French men-of-war, 49
privateers, and 104 merchant ships, besides 176
neutral ships seized as laden with French colonial
produce or military stores&mdash;Boscawen's share was
as we have seen, conspicuous.</p>

<p>It was not until the 1st of November that our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Admiral returned, with four of his ships, to St.
Helen's, having, on the way home, fallen in with six
French ships off the Scilly Islands, of which, however,
he was unable to give his usual good account,
as they sailed much faster than his. He nevertheless
managed to disable one of them, the <i>Belliqueux</i>,
and drove her up the Bristol Channel, where she was
secured by the <i>Antelope</i>.</p>

<p>The following 6th of December was a proud day
for the victorious naval hero; for, in his place in
Parliament, he received the thanks of the House
of Commons. In the course of Speaker Onslow's
address conveying the thanks of the House, he
declared himself 'unable to enumerate and set
forth the great and extensive advantages accruing
to this nation from the conquest of Louisbourg,
with the islands of Cape Breton and St. John,' and
described the vote of thanks as 'a national honour
from a free people, ever cautiously conferred, in order
to be the more esteemed, and the greater reward; a
reward which ought to be reserved for the most
signal services to the State, as well as for the most
approved merit in it.' Boscawen's reply was
characteristically short, modest, and sailor-like. He
said, from his place, 'Mr. Speaker, I am happy in
having been able to do my duty; but have not words
to express my sense of the distinguished reward that
has been conferred upon me by this House; nor can
I enough thank you, sir, for the polite and elegant
manner in which you have been pleased to convey
to me the Resolution.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>The <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> for August, 1758, gives a
long and (to military men at least) an interesting
journal of this important siege, of which the following
is a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">résumé</i><a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>:</p>

<p>Owing to the violence of the surf, great difficulties
appear to have existed in landing the troops and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matériel</i> for the operations; and, on the 23rd June,
Boscawen had to inform his colleague that no less
than 100 boats had, up to that time, been lost in the
various attempts which had been made. Nor was
this the only way in which the naval commander
endeavoured to contribute to the success of the
undertaking, for on the 26th June, with 200 marines,
the Admiral took the French post of Kennington
Cove, which proved, as General Amherst said, 'a
great ease to the army.' To add to the difficulties
of the undertaking small-pox broke out, and proved
fatal in a great many cases&mdash;2,000 men dying from
this and other causes during the expedition; whilst
dense fogs and stormy weather also frequently hindered
the progress of their operations; yet, in spite
of a host of similar discouraging circumstances,
the work was pushed on with truly British vigour
and tenacity. On the 25th of July, Boscawen sent
in boats with 600 men into the harbour, and took
two French ships&mdash;the <i>Prudent</i>, of 74 guns, and the
<i>Bienfaisant</i>, of 64 guns&mdash;whose fire had terribly galled
the besiegers. The former vessel was burnt, as she
was aground; but the <i>Bienfaisant</i> was captured and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
towed into the north-east harbour. Boscawen, in
his letter to Pitt of 28th July, 1758, refers to this
as 'a particular gallant action' on the part of his
captains. A similar operation was to have been
attempted on the following day, but the French had
by this time had enough of it; an offer of capitulation
was made by the Governor, and articles were agreed
upon, including the surrender of the garrison&mdash;over
3,000 men&mdash;as prisoners of war, together with sailors
and naval officers to the number of 2,606. A vast
number of mortars and cannon, etc., were also taken.
Thus the strong fortress of Louisbourg fell, the
islands of Cape Breton and St. John thereupon surrendered,
and a deadly blow was inflicted on the
French arms.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The insurance on vessels to America
at once fell from 25 or 30 to 12 per cent., and on the
26th August the Lord Mayor of London, with many
of the principal citizens, waited on the King to congratulate
him upon the victory. In the course of
their address occurs the following passage, which I
quote as illustrative of the importance which the City
attached to the event, and of the strong anti-Gallic
feeling which prevailed at that time:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'May these valuable acquisitions, so gloriously
obtained, ever continue a part of the British Empire,
as an effectual check to the perfidy and ambition of
a nation whose repeated insults and usurpations
obliged your Majesty to enter into this just and
necessary war. And may these instances of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
wisdom of your Majesty's councils, of the conduct
and resolution of your commanders, and of the intrepidity
of your fleets and armies, convince the world
of the innate strength and resources of your kingdoms,
and dispose your Majesty's enemies to yield to a
safe and honourable peace.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Exeter, Cambridge, and other important places
followed suit.</p>

<p>Boscawen had surely now received</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i24">'Praise enough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fill the ambition of a private man;'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but his career was not to close without his having at
least one more opportunity of distinguishing himself.
In the following year, on the 14th April, 1759, he was
again afloat; on this occasion appointed to the command
in the Mediterranean, with a view to overmastering
the French fleet. Having vainly endeavoured
to entice the enemy out of their harbour at
Toulon, the British Admiral withdrew to Gibraltar
to refit; and whilst here, having ascertained that the
French ships under M. De la Clue had somehow contrived
to pass the Straits without his being able to
prevent them, he came to the conclusion that their
object was to effect a junction with the Brest fleet&mdash;a
consummation which of course Boscawen was
bound to prevent. At once he gave the order for
pursuit, and slipping his war-hounds from the leash,
he came up with the enemy in Lagos Bay, some
150 sea miles north-west of Gibraltar Straits. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
had pursued the Frenchmen all night, and came up
with them at 2 p.m. on the following day, when, after
a furious engagement which lasted some hours, he
captured or destroyed nearly half the enemy's ships,
and thus 'effectually defeated the magnificent scheme
of invading England, with which the French Minister
had for some time amused the military ardour and
romantic spirit of his countrymen.' It is worth
while to give Boscawen's account to the Admiralty
of the memorable action in his own words:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'I acquainted you in my last of my return to
Gibraltar to refit. As soon as the ships were near
ready, I ordered the <i>Lyme</i> and <i>Gibraltar</i>, the only
frigates ready, the first to cruise off Malaga, the last
from Estepona to Ceuta Point, to look out, and give
me timely notice of the enemy's approach.</p>

<p>'On the 17th, at eight in the evening, the <i>Gibraltar</i>
made the signal of their appearance, fourteen sail,
on the Barbary shore, to the eastward of Ceuta. I
got under sail as fast as possible, and was out of the
bay before ten, with fourteen sail of the line, the
<i>Shannon</i> frigate, and <i>Ætna</i> fireship. At daylight I
saw the <i>Gibraltar</i>, and soon after seven large ships
lying to; but on our not answering their signals, they
made sail from us. We had a fresh gale that brought
us up with them fast till about noon, when it fell
little wind. About half an hour past two, some of
the headmost ships began to engage, but I could not
get up to the <i>Ocean</i> till near four. In about half an
hour the <i>Namur's</i> mizzen-mast and both topsail-yards
were shot away. The enemy then made all the sail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
they could. I shifted my flag to the <i>Newark</i>, and
soon after the <i>Centaur</i>, of 74 guns, struck.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>'I pursued all night, and in the morning of the
19th saw only four sail standing in for the land, two
of the best sailers having altered their course in the
night; we were not above three miles from them,
and not above five leagues from the shore, with very
little wind. About nine the <i>Ocean</i> ran among the
breakers, and the three others anchored. I sent
the <i>Intrepid</i> and the <i>America</i> to destroy the <i>Ocean</i>.
Captain Pratten having anchored, could not get in;
but Captain Kirke performed that service alone. On
his first firing at the <i>Ocean</i> she struck, and Captain
Kirke sent his officers on board. M. De la Clue,
having one leg broke and the other wounded, had
been landed about half an hour; but they found the
captain, M. le Compte de Carnes, and several
officers and men, on board. Captain Kirke, after
taking them out, finding it impossible to bring the
ship off, set her on fire. Captain Bently, of the <i>Warspight</i>,
was ordered against the <i>Temeraire</i>, of 74 guns,
and brought her off with little damage, the officers
and men all on board. At the same time, Vice-Admiral
Broderick, with his division, burnt the
<i>Redoubtable</i>, her officers and men having quitted her,
being bulged; they brought the <i>Modeste</i>, of 64 guns,
off, very little damaged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>'I have the pleasure to acquaint their lordships,
that most of his Majesty's ships under my command
sailed better than those of the enemy.</p>

<p>'Enclosed I send you a list of the French squadron,
found on board the <i>Modeste</i>.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>'Herewith you will also receive the number of the
killed and wounded on board his Majesty's ships (56
killed and 196 wounded), referring their lordships for
further particulars to Captain Buckle.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Well might even the gentle poet Cowper say
of so brilliant and important an exploit as this was:
'When poor Bob White brought in the news of
Boscawen's success off the Coast of Portugal, how
did I leap for joy!'</p>

<p>As part of the results of his victory Boscawen took
three large ships and burnt two; and on the 15th of
September reached Spithead with his prizes and 2,000
prisoners. Unfortunately the victory involved us in
a protracted negotiation with the Portuguese, who
complained, not without reason, that the neutrality
of their coasts had been violated. It was on this
occasion that Pitt, in giving, in his letter to Mr. Hay,
then British Minister at Lisbon, his directions for
the conduct of the negotiations, loftily writes on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
12th September, 1759: 'You will be particularly
attentive not to employ any favourable circumstances
to justify what the Law of Nations condemns!' Yet
the great Minister was careful to add in his P.S.
that 'any personal mark on a great Admiral who has
done so essential a service to his country, or on anyone
under his command, <em>is totally inadmissible</em>; as
well as the idea of restoring the ships of war taken.'
The delicate political considerations involved in this
transaction may perhaps account for Boscawen's not
again receiving the thanks of the House; but that the
enormous value of the service which he had rendered
was not unperceived, may be seen from the fact that
the City of Edinburgh embraced this opportunity of
presenting the Admiral with its 'freedom.' After a
while, however, more substantial rewards followed.
He was made a Privy Councillor; and, on 8th
December, 1760, a General of Marines, with a salary
of £3,000 a year. It may be a matter of surprise
with some that no title was conferred upon Boscawen;
but, as a public writer has recently observed: 'Naval
services have been by no means so frequently rewarded
by peerages as military services, especially of
late years; as may be gathered from the fact that
while the Queen has already created thirteen military
peers, she has created only two naval peers&mdash;namely,
the late Sir Edmund Lyons, made Baron Lyons
after the Crimean War in 1856, and Lord Alcester.
Before that the latest naval peerage was the Barony
of De Saumerez conferred on Sir James Saumerez in
1831 by William IV.; and before that, again, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Viscounty of Exmouth, conferred on the Cornish
Admiral Sir Edward Pellew in 1816 by the Prince
Regent. And, even from the age of the great French
War of the end of last and the beginning of the
current century, the titles remaining in the peerage
are far from numerous: Nelson, Bridport, Camperdown,
Gardner, Graves, Hood, Howe, Rodney, and
St. Vincent, nearly or quite exhausting the list.'
In the present instance there was probably the
further consideration that our Admiral's brother
was already a Viscount, whilst his own son was heir
apparent to that title.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We now come to Boscawen's last service&mdash;once
more in the Bay of Quiberon&mdash;where he was posted
with a view to his following up Conflans after his
defeat by Hawke. In this command he was relieved
on the 26th August; and little remains to be told
except the final record that, on the 10th January,
1761, this thoroughbred seaman and gentleman died
of a bilious fever, when only fifty years of age, at his
seat, Hatchlands Park, near Guildford, Surrey. But
his body was laid amongst those of his ancestors in
the remote and quiet little church of St. Michael
Penkivel&mdash;'grata quies patriæ'&mdash;where no more warlike
cannonade was destined to disturb his repose than
the sunset and sunrise gun from Pendennis or St.
Mawes Castles, or from the guard-ship stationed in
the adjacent harbour of Falmouth.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>His monument, of white marble, is an imposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
piece of statuary, the most prominent part of which
is a bust designed by Adam, and executed by
Rysbrack, which well displays the bluff, portly, and
determined features of one of England's bravest and
ablest sons. But, to my mind, the best and loveliest
part of that trophied memorial is the following inscription
from the pen of the well-beloved partner
of all his joys and sorrows:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot small">

<p class="center">'<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Satis Gloriæ sed haud satis Reipublicæ</i>:</p>

<p>'Here lies the Right Honourable Edward Boscawen, Admiral of the
Blue, General of Marines, Lord of the Admiralty and one of his
Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council. His birth tho' noble, his
titles tho' illustrious, were but incidental additions to his greatness.</p>

<p>'History, in more expressive and more indelible characters, will
inform latest posterity with what ardent zeal, with what successful
valour, he served his country, and taught her enemies to dread her
naval power.</p>

<p>'In command he was equal to every emergency&mdash;superior to ev'ry
difficulty. In his high departments masterly and upright. His example
form'd while his patronage rewarded merit.</p>

<p>'With the highest exertions of Military greatness he united the
gentlest offices of humanity.</p>

<p>'His concern for the interest and unwearied attention to the health of
all under his command softened the necessary exactions of duty and
the rigors of discipline by the care of a guardian and the tenderness of
a father.</p>

<p>'Thus belov'd and rever'd, amiable in private life as illustrious in
public, this gallant and profitable servant of his country, when he was
beginning to reap the harvest of his toils and dangers, in the full meridian
of years and glory, after having been providentially preserved
from every peril incident to his profession, died of a fever on the 10th
of Jany. in the year 1761, the 50th of his age, at Hatchlands Park in
Surrey, a seat he had just finished at the expense of the enemies of his
country, and (amidst the groans and tears of his beloved Cornishmen)
was here deposited.</p>

<p>'His once happy wife inscribes this marble&mdash;an unequal testimony of
his worth, and of her affection.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Here perhaps it may conveniently be added that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
his name is still honourably remembered in the
Navy, for the <i>Boscawen</i>, of 101 guns, was one of the
Baltic fleet in 1854; and there is a ship of that name,
now stationed at Weymouth, used as a naval training-ship
for boys.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The career of Admiral Boscawen depicts his
character. It was that of a brave, blunt, determined
sailor of the old school. He could not look at a
French ship without desiring to fight her; and his
determination, according to his enemies, amounted
to obstinacy. Walpole tells us how the Admiral
in 1757 is said to have been recalled from his then
station to serve under Hawke, which he declined to
do, 'and his Boscawenhood is now much more
Boscawened; that is surly in the deepest shade;'
and the same writer says, in another place, that he
was 'the most obstinate man of an obstinate family.'
Yet even Walpole is compelled to pay this somewhat
unwilling tribute to the Admiral's worth during the
perilous time when he served his country so well:
'Never did the bravery of the English and the
want of spirit in the French appear in greater
opposition; the former making their attacks on spots
which the French deemed impregnable, threw them
into utter dismay; and dictated a very quick and
unjustifiable submission&mdash;Boscawen's rough courage
was fully known before.' And a recent critic, who
has already been quoted more than once (himself
a naval officer), thus sums up our hero's character:
'He was virtuous like Anson and Hawke, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
brave and eager for employment and distinction
as Nelson himself.'</p>

<p>But the prize which the Cornish hero must have
valued most must have been the eulogium which
Chatham, when Prime Minister, addressed to him&mdash;words
with which I may not inaptly close this imperfect
sketch of his life and actions:</p>

<p>'When I apply to other officers respecting any
expedition I may chance to project, they always
raise difficulties; <em>you</em> always find expedients.'</p>

<p class="p2" />
<h3><em>MRS. BOSCAWEN.</em></h3>

<p class="noindent">It is not too much to say of the Admiral's wife that
she was worthy of him, and that she was duly proud
of his name and reputation. We have seen how she
thought her daughter Elizabeth was no unfit match
for a duke, remarking that she was '<em>Admiral Boscawen's</em>
daughter;' and she was dearly fond of the sea,
'delighting in it (as she used to say) beyond all
sights and all objects whatever,' until the mournful
day came when he for whose sake she had loved it so
dearly had ended his connexion with it for ever; and
then she spoke of it as that sea whose memories
'had cost her so many tears.' She was the only
daughter of William Evelyn Glanville, Esq., of St.
Clere near Ightham, Kent, and was of the family of
the celebrated John Evelyn, whom she was fond of
calling her 'good, old uncle;' and she took immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
interest accordingly in the production of Dr. Hunter's
new edition of the 'Sylva.'<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>When twenty-four years of age she was married, in
December, 1742, to Admiral Boscawen, seven years
her senior, and they seem to have been a well-suited,
happy couple. Her character is perhaps best seen
in the interesting gossiping letters which she and
Mrs. Delany (a Grenville of Stow) interchanged.
She was also a correspondent of Hannah More and
Mrs. Chapone.</p>

<p>Hannah More, in her 'Sensibility,' writes thus of
her:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Accept, Boscawen! these unpolish'd lays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor blame too much the verse you cannot praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you far other bards have wak'd the string;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far other bards for you were wont to sing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You heard the lyres of Lyttelton and Young;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this a Grace, and that a Seraph strung.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>And in another place she adds:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'On you, Boscawen, when you fondly melt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In raptures none but mothers ever felt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And view, enamour'd, in your beauteous race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All Leveson's sweetness, and all Beaufort's grace!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet think <em>what dangers</em> each lov'd child may share,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youth <em>if valiant</em>, and the maid <em>if fair</em>?'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The reason for dedicating this poem of '<cite>Sensibility</cite>'
to Mrs. Boscawen is glanced at in the following
couplet:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">''Tis <em>this</em>, whose charms the soul resistless seize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gives Boscawen half her pow'r to please.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>
<p>On the death of her husband, Dr. Young thus addressed
her, in a postscript to his poem 'Resignation',</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Why mourn the dead? You wrong the grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From storms that safe resort;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We still are tossing out at sea&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Our <em>Admiral's</em> in port.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>As another illustration of her intimacy with
literary people, and of her fondness for their pursuits,
it may be mentioned that Mrs. Boscawen was one of
the society of 'eminent friends, both ladies and
gentlemen,' who used to meet at Mrs. Montagu's,
where she made herself welcome, says Dr. Doran, by
'the strength of her understanding, the poignancy
of her humour, and the brilliancy of her wit.' A
Mr. Stillingfleet, one of the coterie, was rather
slovenly in his costume, and, amongst other delinquencies,
wore <em>grey</em> stockings, which caused Admiral
Boscawen humorously to affix to the whole party a
name which has now become a household word&mdash;'The
Blue Stockings.'</p>

<p>After they had been dining together on the 29th
April, 1778, at Allan Ramsay's&mdash;when Dr. Johnson
and Sir Joshua Reynolds had been of the party&mdash;Boswell
wrote of Mrs. Boscawen, 'If it be not presumptuous
in me to praise her, let me say that her
manners were the most agreeable, and her conversation
the best of any lady of our party with whom I
had the happiness of being acquainted.' Tenderhearted
and sprightly she undoubtedly was; and,
as an instance of her vivacity, I may perhaps
be excused for quoting a passage in one of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
letters to Mrs. Delany which Lady Llanover has
given in those well-known 'Memoirs' of her ancestress,
to which I have already more than once referred.
'The first time,' writes Mrs. Boscawen, 'I experienced
the pains of child-bearing, I concluded that
no woman had ever endured the like upon the like
occasion, and that I could not possibly recover it;
whereas I danced a minuet about my room in ten
days, to insult my nurse-keeper and set her a scolding
for my diversion!'</p>

<p>But she was something more than a vivacious
letter-writer and a dilettante, for she dabbled too
in political affairs, especially in the Cornish elections,
giving her interest to 'the old members' rather
than to Sir William Lemon in 1774. She took,
of course, great interest in the warlike views of the
day; and on returning to her inn one evening whilst
she was travelling through the country, on hearing
of the retaking of Long Island, 'made a most agreeable
supper and drank health to the noble brothers'&mdash;the
two Howes. When her son-in-law, Mr.
Leveson, had the command of the <i>Valiant</i>, man-of-war,
conferred upon him in November, 1776, she set
to work for him 'with great alacrity,' as she says, to
raise a crew of fishermen in Cornwall. In fact,
throughout her life her correspondence shows that
she took the keenest possible interest in the doings
of our army and navy. As an illustration of the
warlike spirit which at this time pervaded even the
bosoms of the gentler sex, Walpole thus writes in
May, 1778: 'The Parliament is only to have short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
adjournments; and our senators, instead of retiring
to horse-races (<em>their</em> plough), are all turned soldiers,
and disciplining militia. Camps everywhere, and the
ladies in the uniforms of their husbands.' 'It is
said,' writes Mrs. Boscawen to Mrs. Delany, 'that
the Duchess of Devonshire marched through Islington
at the head of the Derbyshire Militia, dressed in
the uniform of that regiment!'</p>

<p>Her residence when in London seems to have been
generally in Audley Street; but she also had a pretty
place at Enfield, and a small house at Colney Hatch
which she used to call her 'nut-shell.'</p>

<p>When about eighty years of age she was living at
Rosedale, a place near the entrance to Richmond
from Kew, which was formerly occupied by the poet
Thomson, whose table, cane, and chair were long
preserved in the house; and whilst residing here a
little poetical correspondence took place which may
be worth recording, not only as an illustration of the
courtly politeness of the time, and of the respect
in which the good old lady was evidently held by her
contemporaries, but also because Mrs. Boscawen's
letter, written in a firm, almost manly hand, notwithstanding
her advanced age, is still preserved in
the British Museum, where it will be found in
the Additional MSS. Pye, the Poet Laureate, had
written a sonnet on Rosedale, which he communicated
to the Rev. W. Butler, who sent it on to Mrs.
Boscawen. The lines, by no means remarkable for
vigour or originality, conclude thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Still Fancy's Train your verdant Paths shall Trace,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tho' clos'd her fav'rite Votary's dulcet lay;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Still Genius thro' your green Retreats shall stray:<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>The lady graciously acknowledged the compliment
conveyed to her in the last two lines, and thus replied
on the 26th June, 1797:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>After surviving her husband for forty-four years,
and never marrying again, the Honourable Frances
Evelyn Boscawen closed her long and amiable life at
her house in Audley Street, in March, 1805, at the
venerable age of eighty-six; and was buried in the
same vault with her husband at St. Michael Penkivel,
where a monument designed by her son, George
Evelyn, third Viscount Falmouth, and executed by
Nollekens, was erected to her memory. An epitaph
does her no more than justice.</p>

was a dignity held immediately under the Crown, and in a Cartulary,
20th Edw. I., the incumbent is called Dean of the King's Free Chapel
of St. Burian. He used to exercise an independent jurisdiction in all ecclesiastical
matters within the parish and its immediate dependencies.
The three prebends belonging to the church of St. Burian were Prebenda
Parva, Prebenda de Respermel and Prebenda de Tirthney; though
there may have possibly been a fourth, called Trethyn, a place in this
parish where there was once a chapel. The first-named Prebend was
in the gift of the Bishop; the two others were annexed to the Deanery
of St. Burian. The 'Deanery' has, however, ceased to be; the three
parishes are separated, and there are now simply Rectors of St. Buryan,
St. Levan, and St. Sennen. (Cf. a paper on 'The Cornish Chantries'

English; Professor Montagu Burrows (Captain R.N.) considers that an
English 70-gun ship of the line was then not more than equal to a
French 52. Many of the vessels were absolutely rotten, and the
provisioning was grossly mismanaged. The officers too, it is said, were
often found combining prudence with valour in somewhat un-English
proportions.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_90_90" id="Footnote_90_90"></a><a href="#FNanchor_90_90"><span class="label">[90]</span></a> 'Hawke's grandfather (says Professor Burrows), a London merchant,
had, like his ancestors for many generations, been settled at Treriven or
Treraven (? Raven on the one-inch ordnance map, near the interesting
old house of Trebasil), in the parish of St. Cleather, in Cornwall, about
half-way between Launceston and Tintagel Head. Cornwall thus has
the honour of having produced the two greatest admirals of the period,
Hawke and Boscawen.' I did not myself venture to claim Hawke as a
Cornishman, inasmuch as his father, a barrister of Lincoln's Inn, settled
at Bocking in Norfolk.</p></div>

Cape Finisterre, though Boscawen had done the service. In this view
Professor Burrows concurs.</p></div>

have had a somewhat chequered history. It was purchased by the
French, from the King of Benjapore, in 1672; it was taken from them
by the Dutch in 1693, who considerably enlarged the town and fortifications.
At the Treaty of Ryswick it was restored to France; in 1748
it was, as we have seen, unsuccessfully besieged by Boscawen; but in
1761, after a long, tedious blockade, it was captured by Coote. At the
Peace of 1763 it was again restored to France; in 1778 it was once
more surrendered to England, and finally it was delivered up to France
in 1783, to become the capital of the French Settlements in India.</p></div>

 pretty little homestead&mdash;or as it is
called in Cornwall, the 'town-place'&mdash;of
Varfel, (or Barfell as it was sometimes
spelt) in Ludgvan, lies on a southern
slope, about two and a half miles N.E. of Penzance,
and is a somewhat less distance from St. Michael's
Mount, a view of which, as well as of the famous
Mount's Bay and of the Lizard district, it commands.
Varfel seems to have belonged from an early period
to the Davy family, some of whose monuments in
Ludgvan Church are nearly 300 years old. Either
here, on the 'paternal acres,' or in the town of Penzance,
on 17th December, 1778, at 5 a.m., was born
to 'Carver' Robert Davy (so called from his proficiency
in his trade as a wood-carver and gilder) and
his wife Grace Millett, their eldest son,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
destined to emerge from this remote and obscure
corner of England, and become President of the
Royal Society&mdash;a man of science so distinguished
that Brande, in his celebrated 'History of Chemistry,'
spoke of Davy's death as nothing less than 'a serious
national calamity.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The district of Penwith, with its wild furze-clad
granite moors, its rugged cliffs, and emerald bays,
proved</p>

<p class="center small">'Fit nurse for a poetic child;'</p>

<p class="noindent">and the imaginative faculties of the future illustrious
chemist were not nursed in vain. Like Pope, he
'lisped in numbers,' reciting, when only five years
old, his own rhymes at some Christmas gambols; and
his poetic vein never left him, even in the laboratory
or in the lecture-room, compelling the aristocratic
idlers of London to love Science, because, as they were
constrained to confess, under his magic guidance,
Science was made beautiful, and was attired by the
Graces. It was said by Coleridge that had Davy not
devoted himself to Science, he would have shone with
the highest lustre as a poet; and the following youthful
lines, full of true local colour, certainly show, as indeed
did his whole life, that he had drunk of 'the fount of
Helicon:'</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>It was this poetic temperament, derived (as his
brother, Dr. Davy, thinks) from their grandmother,
which induced the gifted Dr. Henry, F.R.S., thus
to refer to the subject of this memoir:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Bold, ardent, enthusiastic, Davy soared to
greatest heights; he commanded a wide horizon, and
his keen vision penetrated to its utmost boundaries.
His imagination, in the highest degree fertile and
inventive, took a rapid and extensive range in pursuit
of conjectural analogies, which he submitted to close
and patient comparison with known facts, and tried
by an appeal to ingenious and conclusive experiments.
He was imbued with the spirit and was master in
the practice of inductive logic; and he has left us
some of the noblest examples of the efficacy of that
great instrument of human reason in the discovery
of truth. He applied it, not only to connect classes
of facts of more limited extent and importance, but
to develop great and comprehensive laws, which
embrace phenomena that are almost universal to the
natural world. In explaining those laws he cast
upon them the illumination of his own clear and
vivid conceptions; he felt an intense admiration of
the beauty, order, and harmony which are conspicuous
in the perfect <em>Chemistry of Nature;</em> and he
expressed those feelings with a force and eloquence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
which could issue only from a mind of the highest
powers and of the finest sensibilities.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Davy's first school was at Penzance, his first
schoolmaster a Mr. Bushell; his next, the Rev. Mr.
Coryton, seems to have been one of the old rough
sort, determined that his pupils should not lack correction,
even if they did not profit by his instruction.
He used to address the little boy in the following
doggrel, whenever he thought he saw an opportunity
of administering castigation:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">'Now, Master Davy,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Now, sir! I have 'ee!<br /></span>
<span class="i8">No one shall save 'ee&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Good Master Davy!'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But neither Mr. Coryton, nor Dr. Cardew, the excellent
master of the Truro Grammar School, to which
place Davy was for a short period removed, when
fourteen years old, seems to have perceived any
remarkable genius in the scholar&mdash;except that the
latter discerned at least his taste and skill in poetry,
and in his translations from the classics into English
verse. One of the efforts of his muse was an epic
poem, 'The Tydidiad,' written when he was twelve
years old. In truth Davy, when a schoolboy, was
generally composing either ballads or valentines (in
Latin or English) for his school-fellows, in making
fireworks, or in fishing or shooting, thus proving&mdash;what
has been so often proved before&mdash;that 'the boy
is father to the man.' His oratorical displays&mdash;sometimes
addressed to a crowd of juveniles assembled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
front of the Star Inn at Penzance, sometimes to a
row of empty chairs in his own bedroom&mdash;and his
turnip-lantern exhibitions (which afterwards developed
into the wonderful mimic volcanoes with which he
astonished and delighted his audience at the Royal
Institution) were highly popular; the price of admission
to the turnip-lantern shows is said to have been
paid in an extremely low currency&mdash;pins. It would
moreover appear from an entry of his in the blank
page of his Schrevelius that Harlequin was his
favourite part in a pantomime. Of his youth, which
all accounts agree in representing as genial and
amiable, little more remains to be said, but that he
was very awkward with his hands (often blotting out
an error in his MS. by dipping his fingers into the
ink-bottle)&mdash;could never get out of the 'awkward
squad' in the Volunteer Corps which he joined&mdash;that
he was round-shouldered and clumsy&mdash;had no
taste or ear for music, and possessed a singularly
inharmonious voice. Clearly, the outward gifts of
our hero were not such as were likely to help him
forward on his way through life. To judge what
a change the fire of genius, years of study, and the
advantages of moving amongst cultured and refined
society can accomplish, his portrait, when he was
about thirty-three years old, by Lawrence,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> prefixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
to Dr. Paris's 'Life'&mdash;or perhaps rather that by
Phillips, R.A., which will be found in Polwhele's now
rare little volumes the 'Biographical Sketches,' and
in the 'Gentleman's Magazine' for 1829, should be
examined.</p>

<p>As he grew up he is described as being of about
the middle height, of remarkably active frame, and
with a mobile countenance, which, though the
features were not regular, was full of expression and
vivacity. He had bright, wavy, brown hair, and
eyes 'tremulous with light;' and his voice so improved
by cultivation and experience that it became remarkably
melodious. When to this are added his wonderful
talents, his grand discoveries, and his eloquence, his
sanguine temperament, his purpose firm, his spirits
singularly cheerful and elastic, and his disposition
ever philanthropic, it will easily be believed that his
society was sought by all classes; and it is not to be
wondered at if the attractions which such opportunities
presented laid him open to the charge
(from some quarters) of cultivating too much the
wealthy and the powerful.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Davy, however, was too
wise not to perceive the advantage of interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
such persons in the pursuits to which he was
himself through life devoted. But he was really
fond of intelligence in all classes, whenever and
wherever he met with it; and there is an amusing
story told of one of his street acquaintances, who
showed the moon through a telescope, and who
always refused to take Davy's penny, because, as the
man said, of their being 'brother philosophers.'</p>

<p>But, to return to his youthful days. Davy's schooling
probably did not cost his parents much, for in
Dr. Cardew's time the charges were only £18 a year
for board, and £4 for teaching, and perhaps some
of these were paid by a very kind friend of the
family, Mr. John Tonkin of Penzance. He 'put on
harness' in 1793, when little more than fourteen
years old (the year before his father died), by being
articled on 16th February, to Dr. J. B. Borlase of
Penzance, a gentleman who seems to have taken a
kind and appreciative interest in the welfare of the
lad.</p>

<p>Davy seems to have bestowed a fair amount of
attention upon the studies pertaining to his profession,
and is said to have been particularly kind and attentive
to his master's patients, especially those of
the poorer classes; but 'nourishing a youth sublime'
on the preparation of pills and potions was out of
the question; and we gladly find that, ere long, a
more intellectual banquet was to be laid before him.
He was at this time passionately fond of fishing and
shooting, the former of which pursuits he dearly
loved to the last: casting longing looks, even within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
a few days of his death, on the waters of Lake
Leman on which he had often in earlier days thrown
a fly. His charming book 'Salmonia' (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pace</i> the
shade of Christopher North) shows what a deep
interest he always took in fishing, and, indeed, in
Natural History generally. It is amusing to note
here, that in later years his costume, hat included,
when he went fishing, was, for purposes of concealment,
<em>green</em>; when, however, he went shooting he
adopted scarlet garments for distinction, having a
great dread of being shot. Declamations by the
shores of Mount's Bay were also a source of great
pleasure to him, when a boy, and many a time did
he harangue the waves, when he could not secure a
human auditory.</p>

<p>We may be sure that chemistry was not omitted;
and, in the attic of a house belonging to that worthy
friend of the family&mdash;Mr. Tonkin&mdash;such apparatus
as Davy could muster might have been found: phials,
wine-glasses, teacups, and tobacco-pipes, and a few
acids and alkalies were amongst the principal items,
and&mdash;most treasured of all&mdash;an old clyster-pipe,
washed ashore from a wreck, out of which he had
contrived to manufacture an air-pump!</p>

<p>The crisis of Davy's life at length arrived. Mr.
Davies Gilbert (then named Giddy) a Cornish gentleman
eminent for his attainments, had his attention
called to the youngster's scientific knowledge, and
became his friend and patron&mdash;little thinking at the
time that he was hereafter to become Treasurer of
the Royal Society under Davy, and at length to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
succeed his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</i> as a President. It is noteworthy
here&mdash;that Trelissick House, on the Fal, built by
Davy's grandfather, for Mr. Daniell, became afterwards
the property of Mr. Gilbert, and is now one of
the seats of his grandson, Carew Davies Gilbert, Esq.
Davies Gilbert also brought into public notice the
Rev. Malachi Hitchins, once a miner, afterwards the
principal calculator of the Nautical Almanac, and
(conjointly with Samuel Drew) an historian of Cornwall;
also the Rev. John Hellins, many years assistant
to Dr. Maskelyne. He was moreover an early friend
and adviser of Richard Trevithick (<em>q.v.</em>).</p>

<p>It is said that when the boy Davy first saw Mr.
Davies Gilbert's laboratory his tumultuous delight
knew no bounds. Other appreciative friends now
came forward; amongst them Dr. Edwards of Hayle
Copper House, and Professor Hailstone, and Dr.
Beddoes, representatives of the rival geological
schools of Neptunists and Plutonists, as they were
then called, to both of whom Davy was able to render
valuable information; though he himself, with his
usual sagacity, sided with the Plutonists. Gregory
Watt, the youngest son of the renowned James
Watt, was another of Davy's early acquaintances at
Penzance; and from Watt the youth derived much
valuable information and advice.</p>

<p>One result was the offer of an appointment, when
he was about nineteen years old, as assistant in Dr.
Beddoes's Pneumatic Hospital, at Dowry Square,
Clifton,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>&mdash;an establishment founded for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of investigating the nature of the gases, with especial
reference to their remedial influences.</p>

<p>This was an appointment after the young chemist's
own heart. The salary was sufficient for his modest
wants, and he forthwith renounced all claims to his
share of the small family property, in favour of his
mother and sisters. He threw himself at once with
ardour into his work, and originated those celebrated
but highly dangerous experiments on the effects of
nitrous oxide, which indeed nearly cost him his own
life, but which in their result have alleviated the
sufferings of tens of thousands of his fellow-creatures.
The description of one of the '<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">séances</span>,' when experiments
were tried on many different persons&mdash;including
Southey, then Poet Laureate&mdash;were described
by Davy in an amusing little poem.</p>

<p>The friendship with Southey was not only on a
scientific basis;&mdash;the Poet recognised his brother-poet's
faculty: and accordingly Southey submitted
to Davy the proofs of his mystic poem 'Thalaba,'
for criticism; whilst the younger bard contributed to
the 'Anthology' of the elder. And while on this subject
it may be added that Coleridge (another of his
Clifton acquaintances), who often referred to Davy's
enchanting manners, used to say, so Barrow tells us,
that he was in the habit of attending Davy's lectures
at the Royal Institution, 'in order to increase his
stock of metaphors.' On another occasion Coleridge
remarked: 'There is an energy and elasticity in
Davy's mind which enables him to seize on and
analyze all questions, pushing them to their legitimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
consequences. Every subject in Davy's mind has
the principle of vitality&mdash;living thoughts spring up,
like the turf under his feet.' And Davy, of course,
could not fail to admire the genius of Coleridge&mdash;it
was he who persuaded the dreamy poet to give his
well-known series of eighteen lectures on Shakespeare
at the Royal Institution in 1808. Horne Tooke was
another of Davy's admirers, and was so enchanted
with him early in his career that he engaged Chantry
to make a bust of the Cornish philosopher.</p>

<p>It is further evident that Southey had the highest
possible opinion of Davy's talents, for he wrote thus
to Taylor:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Davy is proceeding in his chemical career with
the same giant strides as at his outset. His book
upon the nitrous oxyd will form an epoch in the
science. I never witnessed such indefatigable
activity in any other man, nor ardour so regulated
by cool judgment.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>In fact our poet-chemist must have been altogether
a most fascinating man. An old personal acquaintance
of his writes in the 'Gentleman's Magazine,'
1845, that 'when Davy is at ease, and excited in conversation,
his splendid eyes irradiate his whole countenance,
and he looks almost inspired.' But perhaps
the best analysis of Davy's powers is that given in
<cite>Good Words</cite> for 1879, by Professor Ferguson, who
has also written by far the most generally interesting
account of the great chemist's discoveries:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Davy's mind,' he says, 'presents so many characteristics,
that one cannot help thinking of it when
perusing the narrative of his life and discoveries. It is
that of the highest type of experimentalists. There
is never any straining after either facts or laws. If
there was a practical problem to solve, there was
an instinctive perception required of the means to
be employed. He asked his questions; Nature replied
gently, kindly. How could she keep silent
when the being she had made to learn from her
inquired? There was never anything superfluous,
for he always saw the aim of the replies no less
than of the questions, and knew what to do next.</p>

<p>'Was it a question in science? the same instinct
guided him to the means. The intensest perception
of real analogies led either to the discovery of new
bodies, and to the unravelling of obscure and perplexed
phenomena, or to the enunciation of views of
general action, which are only now adopted in all
their extent and recognised as true. It was thus
that he declared against the oxygen theory of acids&mdash;that
he was never a devoted convert to Dalton's
atomic views&mdash;and that he was so thoroughly a
dynamician in a science which is still almost entirely
statical. The laboratory, rather than the study,
was the scene of his triumphs; it was there where
his strength lay. No phenomenon was too minute
to escape him; no consequence too improbable not
to be brought into connection with the premises; no
law too wide to be grasped in its known entirety.
In all his work, in all his thinking, there is a magnifi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>cence,
an ever-burning light which makes us lift up
the head and gaze with purified vision upon the
world, and a wild freshness, a provocative thought
which, while we recur to it again and again, and are
never sent away empty, are no less proofs of this
man's vivid and enduring individuality.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Davy's note-books now became rapidly filled with
the Results of his studies, with Reflexions, with Resolutions,
and with the most ambitious prospectuses of
his future labours. Dr. Davy gives, in his 'Life' of
his brother, an interesting specimen, written in 1799,
when Davy had taken a house in Dowry Square,
Clifton. Two hours before breakfast were to be
devoted to his 'Lover of Nature,' or the 'Feelings
of Eldon'&mdash;the five hours from nine to two to experiments&mdash;the
time from four to six was to be spent in
reading, and from seven to ten p.m. in the study of
metaphysics. So passed the time away at Clifton,
amidst the most congenial pursuits, thoroughly
sympathetic friends, and in the enjoyment of an
income which, modest as it was, enabled him to
assist his mother in the education of his younger
brother. But for one thing he bargained&mdash;John was
<em>not</em> to be placed under Mr. Coryton.</p>

<p>Clifton, however, ere long became too small a
sphere for Davy; and in 1801 an appointment as
Assistant Editor of the Journals, Director of the Laboratory,
and Assistant Lecturer (with a view to his
ultimately becoming the Professor of Chemistry) to
the then newly-founded Royal Institution, in London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
was joyfully accepted; his salary being fixed at 100
guineas a year, with a room, and coals, and candles.
The Duchess of Gordon, amongst other leaders of
fashion, attracted by his youth and simplicity, as
well as by his enthusiasm and eloquence, took him
by the hand; and his success became assured. Compliments,
invitations, and presents, Dr. Paris tells us,
were showered upon him from all quarters; his society
was courted by everybody, and all were proud of his
acquaintance. In 1802 he commenced a long series
of lectures before the Board of Agriculture, on the
connexion of Chemistry with Vegetable Physiology,
which have been translated into almost every European
language: in fact, Sir Humphry has been well
named the father of Agricultural Chemistry.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> In 1803
he obtained the enviable distinction of being elected a
Fellow of the Royal Society, and two years afterwards,
having become a Member of the Royal Irish
Academy, he found himself a correspondent of all
the chief scientific men of the day.</p>

<p>Davy's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</i> as a lecturer at the Royal Institution
appears to have been highly successful; 'the sparkling
intelligence of his eye,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> his animated manner,'
according to one critic, and 'his youth, his natural
eloquence, his chemical knowledge, his happy illustrations,
and well-conducted experiments, excited
universal attention and unbounded applause.' It has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>been well said that 'under his touch the coldest
realities blossomed into poetry.' But the real secret
of his success was this&mdash;that he was master of his
subject; and that his whole heart was in his work.
His mode of life, his brother tells us, was at this
time extremely simple, his fare frugal, his rooms
slightly furnished, and the only 'thing of beauty'
which they contained was an exquisite little porcelain
Venus, the gift of his early friend Wedgwood, with
whom he was associated in some of the very first
attempts made in this country in the art of photography.</p>

<p>In 1806 and 1807 he was selected to deliver the
Bakerian Lecture (the subject chosen being the
'Chemical Agencies of Electricity')&mdash;an honourable
distinction&mdash;leading, as it probably did, to his promotion
in the latter year to the posts of Secretary to the
Royal Society, and Member of the Council. Of this
paper Dr. Whewell said, 'It was a great event&mdash;perhaps
the most important event of the epoch under
review,' and as such 'it was recognised at once all
over Europe.' Probably no man's life was happier
than Davy's at this period; his income was ample,
his work was his pleasure, and his disposition was
happy and sanguine. Whilst holding constant and
friendly intercourse with his brother philosophers at
home and abroad,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> he had also plenty of time for
relaxation; and made several pleasant excursions to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Scotland<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> and Ireland; everywhere sketching, making
notes, fishing, or pursuing his inquiries amongst the
natives with a vivid pertinacity and good-nature
which at once astonished and delighted them. His
brother (who used occasionally to occupy an adjoining
bedroom at the Royal Institution) tells how
Humphry might frequently have been heard during
the night addressing in fervid tones some imaginary
audience, or humming aloud an angler's song. Indeed,
it might almost be said that during this period
one cloud only darkened his horizon. He was seized
with typhus fever, caught during an inspection of
Newgate Prison, which he visited with a view to
arranging for its disinfection; but, as Dr. Dibdin
remarked in his introductory lecture to the Institution:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">'&mdash;&mdash; Death his dart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shook, but delayed to strike.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">During Davy's visits to Ireland in 1810 and 1811 he
lectured before the Dublin Society, and whilst in the
Irish metropolis had conferred upon him by Trinity
College the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws.
During the first week 550 tickets for his lectures
were sold at 2 guineas each, and the price ultimately
rose to from 10 to 20 guineas. His own pecuniary
remuneration was also handsome; in the former
year he received 500 guineas, and in the latter £750.</p>

<p>The result of his researches during the eleven years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
whilst he was officially connected with the Royal
Institution may, Dr. Davy thinks, be conveniently
divided into two portions, viz., the <em>earlier one</em>, terminating
with his great discovery of the decomposition
and recomposition of the fixed alkalies, by the aid of
an enormously powerful voltaic pile which he had
specially constructed for him, and the cost of which
was defrayed by subscription&mdash;the reward of his triumphant
and all-important electro-chemical researches;
and the <em>later period</em>, which re-established the simple
nature of chlorine. His views on these subjects
were adopted by all the leading chemists of the age;
and, with few exceptions, were after a short time
promulgated in the schools. To the theory of
tanning he also gave much attention, experimentally
wearing for some time one shoe tanned with oak
bark, and the other with catechu. He published the
results of his inquiries in the 'Philosophical Transactions'
for 1803.</p>

<p>It is not uninteresting here to note that Davy, on
becoming connected with the Royal Society, did not
entirely relinquish his intentions of prosecuting&mdash;what
might probably have been a more lucrative
career&mdash;his original profession of medicine. But
not even such a prospect&mdash;nor even that of an illustrious
career in the Church&mdash;(to which it is said the
Bishop of Durham and others, charmed by his
eloquence as a lecturer, urged him)&mdash;could draw
away his affection from science. And he was not
without his reward; for he had the satisfaction of
reading in Cuvier's address to the French Institute,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
whose members were of course rival scientists,
that&mdash;'Davy, not yet thirty-two, in the opinion
of all who could judge of his labours, held the first
rank among the chemists of this or of any other age.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The month of April, 1812, was an eventful one in
Davy's life. It saw his retirement from the post of
Secretary to the Royal Society; it saw him receive
the honour of Knighthood, then rarely bestowed
upon men of science;<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and last, but not least, it saw
him married to Mrs. Apreece, whose maiden name
was Jane Kerr (of Kelso), a wealthy, amiable, and
intellectual widow, to whom he appears to have been
devotedly attached: he described her, in a letter to
his mother, announcing the intended marriage, as 'a
woman equally distinguished for virtues, talents, and
accomplishments;' and to his brother as 'the most
amiable and intellectual woman I have ever known.'
To this tribute to her worth it may be added that,
when Scott went on his tour to the Hebrides, his
'dear friend and distant relation,' Mrs. Apreece
(afterwards Lady Davy), went with the family party:
she had been, Scott says in one of his letters, 'a
lioness of the first magnitude in Edinburgh' during
the preceding winter. And when writing to Byron,
inviting him to Abbotsford, Sir Walter mentions as
one of the visitors who made his home attractive:
'The fair, or shall I say the sage, Apreece that was,
Lady Davy that is, who is soon to show us how
much science she leads captive in Sir Humphry.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>But there are 'cabinet' portraits of the lady
and her husband in 'The Life of George Ticknor'
(p. 57, vol. i.) which may be introduced here.</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'<em>1815, June 13.</em>&mdash;I breakfasted this morning with
Sir H. Davy, of whom we have heard so much in
America. He is now about thirty-three, but with
all the freshness and bloom of twenty-five, and one
of the handsomest men I have seen in England.
He has a great deal of vivacity&mdash;talks rapidly, though
with great precision&mdash;and is so much interested in
conversation that his excitement amounts to nervous
impatience, and keeps him in constant motion. He
has just returned from Italy, and delights to talk of
it; thinks it, next to England, the finest country in the
world, and the society of Rome surpassed only by
that of London, and says he should not die contented
without going there again.</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'It seemed singular that his taste in this should be
so acute, when his professional eminence is in a
province so different and remote; but I was much
more surprised when I found that the first chemist
of his time was a professed angler; and that he
thinks, if he were obliged to renounce either fishing
or philosophy, that he should find the struggle of
his choice pretty severe.</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>'<em>15 June.</em>&mdash;As her husband had invited me to do,
I called this morning on Lady Davy. I found her
in her parlour, working on a dress, the contents of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
her basket strewed about the table, and looking
more like home than anything since I left it. She
is small, with black eyes and hair and a very
pleasant face, an uncommonly sweet smile; and
when she speaks, has much spirit and expression
in her countenance. Her conversation is agreeable,
particularly in the choice and variety of her
phraseology, and has more the air of eloquence than
I have ever heard before from a lady. But, then,
it has something of the appearance of formality
and display, which injures conversation. Her
manner is gracious and elegant; and though I
should not think of comparing her to Corinne, yet
I think she has uncommon powers.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The honeymoon, the greater part of which was
spent in Scotland, was scarcely over, before, in the
month of June, he dedicated to his wife his 'Elements
of Chemical Philosophy,' as a pledge of his continued
ardour for science, as well as of his love for her;
and Davy returned to his scientific pursuits. In the
following November he nearly lost his eyesight, whilst
performing the dangerous experiment of effecting the
combination of azote, as nitrogen was then called,
and chlorine. He soon, however, completely recovered
the use of his eyes, and took a trip into his
native county; fishing and geologizing on the way.
It was about this time also that Davy made the first
experiments in electric lighting, by producing the
voltaic arc by the use of carbon; the discovery was
improved by Foucault, who substituted retort-carbon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
for wood-charcoal. (Comte du Moncel's 'L'Eclairage
Electrique,' Paris, 1880.)</p>

<p>With reference to this, now highly important, subject,
a writer in the <cite>Times</cite> for 22nd October, 1881,
points out that 'Sir Humphry Davy showed that
when a powerful current passes across the point of
contact of two carbon rods, their points become
heated; and on separating them to a short distance,
an arc of light shoots between them, and the carbons
are raised to a white heat.' The writer adds, that
'all lamps (until lately) had this point chiefly in view;
namely, to introduce an arrangement which should
keep the carbon-points at the fixed distance found to
be the most advantageous.' Surely here was the
germ of that discovery which is now becoming so
rapidly developed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the autumn he went with Lady Davy for a long
tour on the Continent, accompanied by the illustrious
Faraday, who was a bookseller's apprentice when
Davy first knew him, as his assistant and secretary;
and equipped (as on previous similar occasions)
with a portable chemical apparatus. He passed
(with a special passport from Napoleon) through
Paris&mdash;fêted by all the Parisian savants, including
Laplace, Gay-Lussac, Thénard, etc., but treating
them, it is said, somewhat haughtily&mdash;thence through
France and Switzerland into Italy, by way of Nice to
Genoa, where he rested a few days in order to make
some ineffectual experiments on the torpedo; and
so on to Florence, visiting <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> all the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
remarkable extinct volcanoes in the south of France.
This year he was elected a Corresponding Member
of the 1st class of the French Institute, who had
previously awarded to him their prize of 3,000 livres
for his treatise on 'Chemical Affinities.' In the spring
of 1814 he reached Rome, where he spent a month;
and thence visited Naples; all the while filling his
note-books with interesting entries, personal, scientific,
and poetic. On his return homeward he made
the acquaintance of Volta, then seventy years old,
at Milan, and he records his pleasure at conferring
with the ingenious and amiable old man.</p>

<p>Midsummer found him at his beloved Geneva; and
here he spent three delicious months in a villa whose
garden sloped down to the cool blue waters of the
lake. He wintered at Rome, busily occupied with his
scientific pursuits, with shooting wild-fowl in the
Campagna, and in the enjoyment of the intellectual
society of the Eternal City;&mdash;not omitting to
transmit the results of his studies for publication
in the 'Philosophical Transactions.' It was about
this time that the Geological Society of Penzance
was started; and it need scarcely be said that it had
from the first the best wishes of Davy, who contributed
specimens to its cabinets, and subscribed a
handsome sum towards its expenses.</p>

<p>This was not the only institution of a scientific
nature of which Davy was an early patron, if not
indeed an originator. Sir Roderick Murchison, in his
'Biography' by Geikie, mentions that Davy, Croker,
and Reginald Heber were the real founders and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
earliest trustees of the Athenæum Club. And Sir
John Rennie, in his 'Autobiography,' says as follows:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Sir Humphry Davy, in the year 1825, originated
the Zoological Society, and asked me to join, which
I did most willingly; and perhaps it has been the
most popular and successful of any modern society
of that kind. It commenced operations by purchasing
the well-known Cross collection of Exeter
'Change, in which, in my early days, I took an
especial delight; for, considering all things, it was a
very wonderful collection, and it is difficult to understand
how, in such a confined and unhealthy spot, it
could have been maintained in such good condition.
The only other exhibition of the kind in London was
at the Tower; the collection of animals there consisted
of presents from the sovereigns of different
countries. These were afterwards lent to the Zoological
Society, who established their museum in the
Regent's Park; and taking it altogether, it is probably
the finest and best maintained in the world.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>In the spring of 1815 he returned to England, <em>viâ</em>
Mayence and Brussels, and bought for his residence
a house in Lower Grosvenor Street, No. 28.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is perhaps no subject connected with the
career of Davy with which his name is more inseparably
and more honourably associated than that
now to be mentioned,&mdash;and it was a subject which
even the genius of a Humboldt had failed to master&mdash;namely,
the brilliant and philanthropical discovery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the Safety Lamp (the original lamp in its first and
simplest form is preserved in the Royal Institution),
which has often been described in detail. His
brother goes fully into the train of reasoning and of
experiments which led to its construction. It is, as
he says, a cage of wire-gauze which actually makes
prisoner the flame of the deadly fire-damp, and in
its prison consumes it. This grand invention&mdash;and
it is not the less grand because it is so simple&mdash;by
which in all probability more lives have been saved
than by any other invention of similar character,&mdash;Davy
nobly refused to patent, lest the sphere of its
usefulness should be restricted: indeed, throughout
his life he was indifferent to mere money; he was
constantly giving away things for which he had no
immediate use, and never kept a book after he had
once read it. He received for the invention of the
Safety Lamp unbounded praise and heartiest thanks
from the great body of coal-owners and coal-workers
of the Tyne and Wear especially; and was presented
by them, on 11th October, 1817, with a magnificent
service of plate worth £2,500,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> at a public dinner at
the Queen's Head Hotel, Newcastle, when the Earl of
Durham (then Mr. Lambton) said in the course of
his speech: 'If your fame had needed anything to
make it immortal, this discovery alone would have
carried it down to future ages, and connected it with
benefits and blessings.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Of this lamp (which the miners call 'a Davy,') the
inventor, with his usual philanthropic spirit, often
said, 'I value it more than <span class="smcap">anything I ever did</span>.'
The Emperor of Russia sent him a magnificent
silver-gilt vase, the cover of which was surmounted
by a figure of the God of Fire weeping over his
extinguished torch, and the present was accompanied
by an autograph letter. Early in the following year,
his services to Science and to Humanity were recognised,
somewhat tardily, by his having a baronetcy
conferred upon him by the English Sovereign.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the summer of 1818 he contemplated a second
visit, with Lady Davy, to the Continent. The programme
included Flanders, Austria, Rome, and
Naples,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> to the two last of which places he went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>commissioned by the Prince Regent to investigate at
Pompeii the bases of the colours employed by the
ancients in their frescoes; and to discover, if possible,
some chemical process of unrolling the papyric MSS.
affected by the fire at Herculaneum: in this, however,
he was unsuccessful; and his want of success&mdash;a
thing so unusual with him&mdash;afforded him infinite
chagrin. Most of the summer and part of the
autumn of 1819 were spent in luxurious repose at the
baths of Lucca; but the winter found him again at
Rome, all the while making notes and storing up
thoughts for his delightful book, 'The Consolations
of Travel.'</p>

<p>In the summer of 1820 he returned, by way of the
south of France, to his house in Grosvenor Street,
and deeply interested himself in an inquiry into the
'Connexion between Magnetism and Electricity,' the
result of which he communicated to the Royal
Society on the 12th November.</p>

<p>Again he visited Scotland; and Lockhart gives a
graphic account of the party at Abbotsford, in the
autumn of this year, as they started on a sporting
expedition, in which, after sketching the portraits of
some members of it, Scott's biographer goes on to
say:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'But the most picturesque figure was the illustrious
inventor of the safety-lamp. He had come for his
favourite sport of angling, and had been practising it
successfully with Rose, his travelling companion, for
two or three days preceding this; but he had not prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
for coursing fields, or had left Charlie Purdie's
troop for Sir Walter's on a sudden thought; and
his fisherman's costume&mdash;a brown hat with flexible
brim, surrounded with line upon line, and innumerable
fly-hooks; jack-boots worthy of a Dutch smuggler,
and a fustian surtout dabbled with the blood of
salmon&mdash;made a fine contrast with the smart jackets,
white cord breeches, and well-polished jockey-boots
of the less distinguished cavaliers about him.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>After a merry lunch at Newark Castle they all
moved on towards Blackandro, and, Lockhart continues:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Davy, next to whom I chanced to be riding, laid
his whip about the fern like an experienced hand,
but cracked many a joke, too, upon his own jack-boots;
and, surveying the long eager battalion of
bush-rangers, exclaimed: "Good Heavens, is it thus
that I visit the scenery of the 'Lay of the Last
Minstrel'!" He then kept muttering to himself as
his glowing eye (the finest and brightest that I ever
saw) ran over the landscape, some of those beautiful
lines from the conclusion of the 'Lay':</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i24">"But still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When summer smiled on sweet Bowhill,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>'Mackenzie ("The Man of Feeling"), spectacled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
though he was, saw the first sitting hare, gave the word
to slip the dogs, and spurred after them like a boy.
All the seniors, indeed, did well as long as the course
was upwards; but when puss took down the declivity,
they halted, and breathed themselves upon the knoll,
cheering gaily, however, the young people who dashed
past and below them. Coursing on such a mountain
is not like the same sport over a set of fine English
pastures. There were gulfs to be avoided, and bogs
enough to be threaded; many a stiff nag stuck fast,
many a bold rider measured his length among the
peat-hags; and another stranger to the ground besides
Davy plunged neck-deep into a treacherous well-head,
which, till they were floundering in it, had
borne all the appearance of a piece of delicate green
turf. When Sir Humphry emerged from his involuntary
bath, his habiliments garnished with mud, slime,
and mangled water-cresses, Sir Walter received him
with a triumphant "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Encore!</i>" But the philosopher
had his revenge; for, joining soon after in a brisk
gallop, Scott put Sibyl Grey to a leap beyond her
prowess, and lay humbled in the ditch, while Davy,
who was better mounted, cleared it and him at a
bound. Happily there was little damage done, but no
one was sorry that the "sociable" had been detained
at the foot of the hill.</p>

<p>'I have seen Sir Humphry in many places, and in
company of many descriptions; but never to such
advantage as at Abbotsford. His host and he delighted
in each other, and the modesty of their
mutual admiration was a memorable spectacle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Davy was, by nature, a poet; and Scott, though anything
but a philosopher in the modern sense of that
term, might, I think it very likely, have pursued the
study of physical science with zeal and success, had
he chanced to fall in with such an instructor as Sir
Humphry would have been to him, in his early life.
Each strove to make the other talk, and they did so
in turn more charmingly than I ever heard either
on any other occasion whatsoever. Scott, in his
romantic narratives, touched upon a deeper chord of
feeling than usual, when he had such a listener as
Davy; and Davy, when induced to open his views upon
any subject of scientific interest in Scott's presence,
did so with a degree of clear energetic eloquence, and
with a flow of imagery and illustration, of which
neither his habitual tone of table-talk (least of all in
London) nor any of his prose writings (except,
indeed, the posthumous "Consolations of Travel")
could suggest an adequate notion. I say his prose
writings, for who that has read his sublime quatrains
on the "Doctrine of Spinoza" can doubt that he
might have united, if he had pleased, in some great
didactic form, the vigorous ratiocination of Dryden
and the moral majesty of Wordsworth? I remember
William Laidlaw whispering to me one night, when
their "rapt talk" had kept the circle round the fire
until long after the usual bed-time of Abbotsford:
"Gude preserve us! this is a very superior occasion!
Eh, sirs!" he added, cocking his eye like a bird.
"I wonder if Shakespeare and Bacon ever met to
screw ilk other up!"'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">I am also indebted to Lockhart for the following
story:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'When Sir Walter Scott was debating in his mind
the Prince Regent's offer of a baronetcy, he wrote to
his friend Morritt: "After all, if one must speak for
themselves, I have my quarters and emblazonments
free of all stain but Border theft and high treason,
which I hope are gentlemanlike crimes; and I hope
'Sir Walter Scott' will not sound worse than 'Sir
Humphry Davy,' though my merits are as much
under his, in point of utility, as can well be imagined.
But a name is something, and mine is the better of
the two."' When Mrs. Davy, Dr. Davy's wife, told
Sir Walter Scott, at Malta, that her husband was
writing his brother's life, Sir Walter said, 'I am glad
of it; I hope his mother lived to see his greatness.'
And it is pleasant to be able to record such was the
case.</p>

<p>Not only Sir Walter Scott, but even the cold and
reserved Poet of the Lakes, was deeply impressed with
Davy's genius. Lockhart tells us that when Sir
Walter and Wordsworth ascended Helvellyn, 'they
were accompanied by an illustrious philosopher, who
was also a true poet, and might have been one of the
greatest of poets had he chosen; and I have heard
Mr. Wordsworth say that it would be difficult to
express the feelings with which he, who so often had
climbed Helvellyn alone, found himself standing on
its summit with two such men as <em>Scott</em> and <em>Davy</em>.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The crowning honour of Davy's life now awaited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
him. His friend Sir Joseph Banks&mdash;himself the
successor of such men as Sir Christopher Wren, Sir
Hans Sloane, and Sir Isaac Newton&mdash;who had held
the post of President of the Royal Society for forty-two
years, died on 19th June, 1820, and Sir Humphry
was, almost unanimously, elected on the 30th of the
following November. He continued to fill the post
for seven successive years, and his annual addresses
are very characteristic specimens of his eloquence
and suavity. He retained the old practice of delivering
his speeches in full court dress,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and with the
Society's mace (Oliver Cromwell's celebrated 'bauble')
laid before him. He also continued his predecessor's
practice of having weekly evening gatherings of the
most distinguished men of science of the day, so long
as he remained in Lower Grosvenor Street; but they
were discontinued on his moving, in 1825, to 26,
Park Street, Grosvenor Square.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Davy now began to find that</p>

<p class="center small">'Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.'</p>

<p class="noindent">He was worried by the numerous small duties which
pertained to his prominent position, and was sadly
disappointed at not being able to prevail upon the
Government of the day to take up his somewhat
magnificent views as to the development of the Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Society, and the subordination of certain other great
public establishments to it. He used to complain
that the Government were only too glad to get anything
they could out of the Society, but were loth
to give back anything in return. I gather too, from
what Dr. Davy says, that symptoms of failing health
began, even thus early, to show themselves. He
somewhat relaxed the severity of his labours&mdash;made
trips to Ireland, Wales, and Scotland (dining at
Edinburgh with Sir Walter Scott), chiefly with a view
to enjoying the fine scenery, and the fishing and
shooting; but, as regards Wales, also with the object
of devising means for remedying the results produced
by the noxious copper effluvia from the Smelting
Works at Swansea.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1821 he paid a visit to Penzance;
always fond&mdash;as indeed most Cornishmen seem to
be&mdash;of embracing an opportunity of revisiting his
native place. On this occasion he was entertained
at a public dinner; and he left his old home, doubtless
expecting to see it again and again: but this was
destined to be his last visit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From 1823 to 1826 may be described as the last
period of his scientific labours; and it was in a great
measure devoted to investigations, undertaken at the
request of the Government, into the best mode of
preventing the destruction of the copper-sheathing
of vessels by the action of the sea. This Davy
to some extent accomplished by coating the copper
with tin; but, unfortunately, the tin did not prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
(as the copper did) the fouling of the metal by
accretions of seaweeds and shells; and the practical
result was nil.</p>

<p>He was much disappointed at this, having taken
great pains in the matter, and having even made a
voyage to the North Sea for the purpose of conducting
his experiments. Of this excursion, which
included visits to Norway, Sweden, and Denmark,
he has left copious records&mdash;though, as a general
rule, he had now discontinued his diary&mdash;and these
include his reflexions not only on the scenery, etc.,
through which he passed, but, according to his custom,
his impressions of the distinguished men of science
and others with whom he came in contact. Those
circumstances which impressed Davy most deeply he
often recorded, as was his practice throughout his
life, in verse. A specimen may be given here in the
following fragment written at Ullswater, which he
visited in August, 1825:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ye lovely hills that rise in majesty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst the ruddy light of setting suns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your tops are bright with radiance, while below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wave is dark and gloomy, and the vale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hid in obscurest mist. Such is the life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Man: this vale of earth and waters dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gloomy&mdash;but the mountains range above!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sky&mdash;the heavens are bright!&mdash;&mdash;'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But he could not succeed in shaking off the illness
of which he had had more than one warning; and
even his elastic spirits began to flag under its
depressing influence. The spring of 1826 found him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
worse; he complained much of rheumatism, and of
slight numbness in his limbs; and the death of his
mother in the autumn still further affected his health.
With great pain and effort he delivered what proved
to be his last address to the Royal Society&mdash;a body
whose mission was so like his own, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">'ad inquisitionem
et inventionem naturæ veræ et interioris rerum omnium'</span>&mdash;on
St. Andrew's Day, 1826; and shortly after
he suffered a slight attack of paralysis, which, however,
did not prevent his revising his discourses, nor
even deter him from projecting new scientific treatises.
During his recovery he liked nothing better
than having novels and romances read to him,&mdash;partly
I should think to divert his mind from the
small worries which were inevitable to one occupying
the post which he filled, but which at this juncture
pressed upon him with increasing force, and indeed
probably conduced to his determining upon another
visit to the Continent in January, 1827, accompanied
on this occasion only by his brother, Dr. John Davy,
an army surgeon.</p>

<p>The winter journey was rough and dreary. Paris
was avoided, on account of the too great excitement
which it was feared its society might induce; and
the roads along which the travellers drove, bad at
the best, were now in their very worst condition from
the snow. The scenes through which they passed
were uninteresting, the occasional roadside churches
being the only noteworthy objects; and these they
rarely failed to enter, the sick philosopher generally
dropping on his knees for a silent prayer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>So they passed on, notwithstanding the severe cold
and the snow, over the Mont Cenis, into Italy,
reaching Ravenna on the 27th February&mdash;Davy,
strange to say, rather the better than the worse
for his cold and cheerless expedition. Here he
rested for some time, occupying himself chiefly in
shooting, fishing, and reading Byron, whose acquaintance
(with that of the accomplished Countess
Guiccioli) he had previously made at this place.
His note-book was kept up, and was filled with
numerous acute observations on subjects connected
with natural history and chemistry, interspersed with
expressions of pious humility and of gratitude to
'the Great Cause of all being.' His health improved;
and in March, 1827, Dr. Davy returned
to Corfu, whilst Sir Humphry shortly afterwards
started on a solitary expedition through the Eastern
Alps and down the Rhine. But his health now
declined; he frequently had to apply leeches and
blisters, and he lived so abstemiously as to considerably
reduce his strength and spirits. 'Valde
miserabilis!' he often exclaimed in his note-book;
and once he wrote, 'Dubito fortissime restaurationem
meam.' It was no doubt whilst in this mood that
he wrote to Mr. Davies Gilbert from Salzburg, on
30th June, 1827, announcing his retirement from the
office of President of the Royal Society.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Whilst
on one of his numerous fishing expeditions, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
pursuit<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> which, as we have seen, he passionately
followed all his life long, he wrote about this time,
the following pensive lines, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">more suo</i>, on contemplating
a rapid river:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'E'en as I look upon thy mighty flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Absorb'd in thought, it seems that I become<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A part of thee, and in thy thundering waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My thoughts are lost, and pass to future time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeking the infinite, and rolling on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towards the eternal and unbounded sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the All-Powerful, Omnipresent Mind.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>This was a favourite thought of his. He amplified
it in a letter which he addressed from Rome in the
following year to his friend Poole:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'I have this conviction full on my mind,' he wrote,
'that intellectual beings spring from the same breath
of Infinite Intelligence, and return to it again, but by
different courses. Like rivers born amid the clouds
of heaven, and lost in the deep and eternal ocean&mdash;some
in youth, rapid and short-lived torrents; some
in manhood, powerful and copious rivers; and some
in age, by a slow and winding course, half lost in
their career, and making their exit by many sandy
and shallow mouths.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The current of his own life now carried him back
in one of its eddies to London, which he reached on
6th October.</p>

<p>The winter was passed in town, but the state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
his health prevented any great exertion, and did not
permit his seeing much society; yet the world can
scarcely be said to have been the loser; for in his
retirement he composed (being now nearly fifty years
of age), that delightful book, dear to every angler,
'Salmonia.'<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Returning spring revived his desire to
revisit what he considered the finest scenery in the
world, namely, the Alpine valleys of Illyria and
Styria; and at the end of March he left England,
accompanied by a young medical gentleman (his
godson), Mr. Tobin, the son of a much-valued old
friend. His pursuits were much as usual, and, living
somewhat more generously, he more than once entertained
some faint hopes of his ultimate recovery;
'attaching,' as he himself put it, 'a loose fringe, of
hope to his tattered garments.' His mind was fully
active during this summer, as may be judged from
his having now planned his well-known work, 'Consolations
of Travel,' which he used to say 'contained
the essence of his philosophical opinions;' and from
his having sketched out a slight plan for his own
memoirs. Stress of weather detained him a short
time at Wurzen, and here he occupied the time of
his detention by writing his little Irish romance,
'The Last of the O'Donoghues.' He also now sent
to press the second edition of his 'Salmonia,' which
he thought 'twice as good, as well as twice as big' as
the first. At Trieste he resumed his experiments on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the electric eel, and at length satisfied himself that
under no conditions did the shock affect the magnet.
This formed the subject of a paper&mdash;the last of a
series which continued almost uninterruptedly for a
period of twenty-eight years&mdash;published by the Royal
Society. It was about this time that he made the
noble and touching entry in his diary:</p>

<p lang="it" xml:lang="it" class="small">'Si moro, spero che ho fatto il mio dovere; e che mia vita non e
stato vano ed inutile.'<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>The curtain rises on the last act, at Rome, where
he passed the winter. Here&mdash;where he describes
himself, in a letter dated 6th February, 1829, to his
friend Poole, as 'a ruin among ruins'&mdash;he received,
a fortnight after that date, his last and fatal shock of
paralysis. It was quite unexpected by him, and he
was barely able to write one or two hurried letters to
his brother, begging him to come quickly. He now
quite made up his mind that he was about to die;
but his mind continued calm and clear, and he urged
Dr. Davy, when he at length arrived, not to give
way to any vain regrets, but to regard the matter
philosophically. Even in this extremity, the consideration
of the strange powers of the torpedo
exercised a fascinating influence over him; and he
directed experiments and dissections of the fish from
the bed upon which he not only believed himself to
be dying, but upon which he thought, more than once,
that he had actually died. Only with great difficulty
was he persuaded by his wife and surrounding friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
that he had not as yet passed the dark portals of the
grave.</p>

<p>It will hardly be believed that from such a state
as this he rallied. Yet such was the case! Lady
Davy had brought with her from England an early
copy of the second edition of his 'Salmonia;' and
he read it with avidity. Indeed reading&mdash;or rather
being read to&mdash;was now almost his only pursuit.
Moore's 'Epicurean,' Shakespeare, 'The Arabian
Nights,' and 'Humphrey Clinker,' by turns engaged
his attention; and at length he not only thought
recovery possible, but by April was actually able
to take drives about Rome and its neighbourhood,
entering fully, with his companions, into all the enjoyment
of the charms of a brilliant Italian spring.</p>

<p>At length, leaving Rome, 'by slow and easy stages,'
they came to Geneva, which place they reached on
the 28th May, by the Mont Cenis route. Here the
little party took up their residence at La Couronne
hotel, which overlooks the lake; and Davy expressed
an earnest desire once more to throw a fly on it.
He was very deeply affected on hearing of the
death of his old friend Dr. Thomas Young; but
dined heartily with the others at five o'clock. After
dinner he was heard joking with the waiter as to
the cooking of the fish, and desiring that he might
be furnished with a specimen of every variety which
the lake contained; and, after being read to as usual,
he went to bed at nine. In rising, however, from his
chair at the dinner table, for this purpose, he gave
his elbow a rather violent blow, the sensations resulting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
from which frightened him very much, and probably
accelerated his decease. At half-past two in
the morning the servant aroused Dr. Davy with the
information that his illustrious brother was much
worse. The doctor flew to the chamber, but only in
time to see Sir Humphry expire, just as the morning
of the 29th of May, 1829, began to dawn.</p>

<p>His will was proved under £30,000, and Lady
Davy was appointed sole executrix. Paris says
that he left £100 to the Penzance Grammar School,
the interest to be devoted to a prize for the best
scholar, provided the school kept holiday on the
anniversary of his birthday; but I do not find this in
the will. I believe that the interest on the money is
still paid, but that the holiday is omitted.</p>

<p>A public funeral was decreed him by the authorities
and literati of Geneva, including his friends
Decandolle and Sismondi, who highly appreciated
him; and his mortal remains were deposited in the
cemetery at Plain-Palais, close to those of Professor
Pictet.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> It was Davy's wish, as expressed in his
will, to be buried wherever he might die: 'Natura
curat suas reliquias,' he wrote; and on his monument
will be found the reason of this lofty reliance&mdash;namely,
because he was</p>

<p class="center small">'Summus arcanorum Naturæ indigator.'<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a>
   <a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a><br /></p>

<p>Thus died, without issue, and within a few months
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>of his great friends Wollaston and Young, Sir
Humphry Davy, poet and philosopher, before he
had completed his fifty-first year&mdash;a man (to use the
words of Dr. Paris) 'whose splendid discoveries
illumined the age in which he lived, adorned the
country which gave him birth, and obtained from
foreign and hostile nations the homage of admiration
and the meed of gratitude.'</p>

<p>His genius it would be presumptuous in me to
endeavour to analyze or describe. I have attempted
a biographical sketch rather than an essay on Davy's
proper place in the ranks of science;<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> but he
was undoubtedly one of the master-spirits of his
age; and I gladly select, from among many other
similar accounts, the peroration of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éloge</i> pronounced
upon him by Baron Cuvier before the
Institute of France:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">'Ainsi a fini à cinquante ans, sur une terre
étrangère, un génie dont le nom brillera avec éclat
parmi cette foule s'éclatante de noms dont s'enarguillit
la Grande Bretagne. Mais, que dis je, pour
un tel homme aucune terre n'est étrangère; Genève
surtout ne pouvait pas l'être, où, depuis vingt ans, il
comptait des amis intimes, des admirateurs sans
cesse occupés de répandre ses decouvertes sur le
Continent; aussi, le deuil n'eût pas été plus grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The talented and indefatigable editors of the
'Bibliotheca Cornubiensis' have observed that, since
the formation of the Royal Society, fifty-eight persons,
either born in Cornwall or long resident within its
borders, have become, through their eminence in
mineralogical and other pursuits, Fellows of that
body. A full list of their names is printed in the
index to Messrs. Boase and Courtney's work; and
in it they rightly say that Cornishmen may be pardoned
for believing that no such record of distinction
in scientific knowledge could be drawn up from any
English county of corresponding size and population.
I will only add my opinion that, amongst the
foremost in that bright roll of honour, stands forth
the name of HUMPHRY DAVY.</p>

<p class="drop-capi2"><span class="smcap">The</span>
 life of this gallant sailor and good man
was told so admirably in 1835, by my late
valued friend, Edward Osler, F.L.S.&mdash;for
many years editor of the <cite>Royal Cornwall
Gazette</cite>, and himself one of our Cornish Athenæ&mdash;that
his memoir must necessarily form the backbone of
any account of Lord Exmouth's career. To Mr.
Osier's well-known work I would therefore refer
those who desire a more detailed account than
space allows me to give to the subject of this
chapter. I should, however, add that I have been
fortunate enough to gather some facts to which even
Mr. Osier does not refer in his elaborate memoir.</p>

<p>Lord Exmouth's career was both eventful and
distinguished; but, notwithstanding its brilliancy, his
chief glory was his unswerving devotion to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
country, irrespective of all party feeling (and he was
a strong Tory)&mdash;his generosity in recognising to the
fullest extent the merits of his subordinates&mdash;his
combined strictness and kindness to his men&mdash;and
his constant recognition of the Divine Hand in all
his victories. No vessel under the orders of Pellew
was ever taken by the enemy.</p>

<p>Like many another Cornish worthy, Edward
Pellew was a man of comparatively small beginnings.
Originally, it is said, of Norman extraction, the
Pellews were an old-established West Cornwall
family, whose tombs may still be found at Breage.
Humphry Pellew, his grandfather, an American
merchant, the builder of part of the little town of
Flushing in Falmouth harbour, took for his wife,
in 1692, Judith Sparnon of Sparnon and Pengelly
in Breage, by whom he had six children; but the
children of Samuel, the youngest son (who was
only eight years old when his father died in 1721),
were at length the only male survivors of the family.
This Samuel Pellew, Lord Exmouth's father, a man
of determined character, commanded a post-office
packet on the Dover station. He married in 1752
Constance, daughter of Edward Langford, Esq., of
a Herefordshire family, settled at or near Penzance&mdash;a
woman, Mr. Osier says, 'of extraordinary spirit,'
and fitted, as indeed her husband also was, to be a
parent of heroes.</p>

<p>In 1765 Samuel Pellew died, leaving a widow and
six children; of whom Edward, the second, was
born at Dover, 19th April, 1757. In 1765 he removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
with his mother to Penzance; and here, when
quite a child, gave an early instance of his love of
the 'pomp and circumstance of glorious war,' by
walking all the way from Penzance to Helston,
in order to follow a troop of soldiers; and of his
indomitable courage, when somewhat older, by
removing from a burning house a quantity of gunpowder
which had been stored there. He frequently
played truant from school in order to get into a boat
at the quay; and was a great favourite with the loafers
there, who taught him to box. Bottrell says that
Mrs. Pellew and her family lived in a thatched cottage
'near the Alverton entrance to Fox's gardens;' the
house still stands, on the left-hand side of the road as
the traveller leaves Penzance for the Land's End.</p>

<p>The Truro Grammar School, where the Rev. R.
Polwhele was one of his schoolfellows, as appears
from his 'Reminiscences,'<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> was the next scene of his
combative energy; and here he thrashed so many of
his schoolfellows, that, in order to escape a still
severer thrashing with which the head-master (then
Mr. Conon) threatened him, he ran away, and&mdash;against
his grandfather's consent, but luckily for
English glory, and for his own fame&mdash;went to sea.
Whilst at Truro, hastening through the courtyard of
the Red Lion Hotel to assist in putting out a fire,
Pellew found the high back gate shut; but he sprang
over it, and I remember the spot being pointed out to
me in evidence of his strength and agility. His freaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
on the water in after-life were of the most daring kind,
and he often set the example on board ship, when
no sailor could be found bold and active enough to
perform some dangerous act of seamanship.</p>

<p>In the year 1770, being then about thirteen or fourteen
years of age, Edward Pellew entered the Navy
in the <i>Juno</i>, and went his first voyage to the Falkland
Islands. Thence, under the same captain (Stott), he
sailed in the <i>Alarm</i> to the Mediterranean, where, at
Marseilles&mdash;a place which he was destined afterwards
to save from destruction by its own inhabitants&mdash;he
left the ship, in consequence of a gross and uncalled-for
insult inflicted by the Captain on one of Pellew's
brother midshipmen, named Cole.</p>

<p>He next joined the <i>Blonde</i>, under Captain Pownoll&mdash;who
had been trained in the school of another
Cornish naval hero, Admiral Boscawen&mdash;and with
whom he soon became a prime favourite. It was on
board the <i>Blonde</i> that he so alarmed and amused
General Burgoyne, by standing on his head on the
yard-arm when the General came on board to make
his ill-starred expedition to America; and from the
fore-yard of the same ship Pellew sprang to rescue a
man who had fallen overboard. His magnificent physique
and perfect courage enabled him to perform
similar services on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>A smart engagement with a superior American
force on Lake Champlain was his next exploit, in
which, though unsuccessful, he found another opportunity
of showing his coolness and bravery; and his
services on this occasion gained him his lieutenant's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
commission. Shortly afterwards he very nearly captured,
single-handed, the American Commander-in-Chief
Arnold. The stock and buckle, which General
Arnold left behind him in his flight, were long (and
perhaps still are) preserved by the Pellew family.</p>

<p>Joining Burgoyne's unlucky army, and sharing in
all the dangers and hardships which it underwent,
Pellew, though only twenty years old, was summoned
to the council of war at Saratoga, at which (against
his own advice) it was resolved, in October, 1777, to
capitulate to an American force of double the strength
of the English. On his way home to England, in a
transport, he fought an American privateer, and beat
her off with his usual pluck and skill.</p>

<p>On receiving his commission to a guard-ship, he
threatened to throw it up rather than remain at so
inactive a post; and it was not until he declared his
intention to command a privateer that he obtained
his appointment to the <i>Licorne</i>, in which he sailed
for Newfoundland in the spring of 1779. He returned,
however, to England in the following winter,
and joined the <i>Apollo</i>, under his old friend&mdash;his 'only
one on earth,' as he said&mdash;Captain Pownoll, taking
part in an engagement with the French frigate
<i>Stanislaus</i>, on which occasion the Captain left to
Pellew the honour of completing her capture.</p>

<p>The old sloop <i>Hazard</i>, of which he was promoted
to be commander, was his next ship, and the East
Coast of Scotland his station in the summer of 1780.
Then followed the <i>Pelican</i>, a French prize, whilst
commanding which he drove ashore some French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
privateers near the Isle of Bass, an exploit for which
he was made a post-captain on board the <i>Suffolk</i>:&mdash;thus
obtaining every step in his profession as a
reward for some successful action. When it is
added that, whilst in temporary command of the
<i>Artois</i>, he captured on 1st July, 1782, the French
frigate <i>Prince of Robego</i>, we may conclude this part
of his career by observing that this was his last service
before the Peace, which left him without any
employment in His Majesty's service for four years.</p>

<p>The year 1783 saw him a denizen of Truro,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> and
married to Susan, daughter of J. Frowde, Esq., of
Knowle, in Wiltshire. Doubtless, in his wooing, he
told her&mdash;</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Of all the wonders of the mighty deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tales that would make a maiden love to weep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of perils manifold and strange, and storms,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Which Death, careering on the terrible sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Puts on to prove the true knight's constancy.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It was probably about this time, also, that he
became, according to Polwhele, a member of the
Truro Corporation. He soon, however, removed to
Flushing, near Falmouth, a curious little village,
which had for Pellew, as we have seen, family
associations, and where his elder brother, Samuel
Humphry, formerly a surgeon of Marines, was collector
of the Customs.</p>

<p>In 1786 we find him on board the <i>Winchelsea</i>, and
once more on the Newfoundland station, into every
harbour of which he squeezed his ship with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
utmost intrepidity, often exhibiting remarkable feats
of personal strength and activity.</p>

<p>The <i>Winchelsea</i> was paid off in 1789, and till 1791
Captain Pellew served in the <i>Salisbury</i>, of 50 guns,
again on the Newfoundland station; and this time
with his younger brother, Israel, as first lieutenant.
He afterwards became Admiral Sir Israel Pellew,
K.C.B.&mdash;an officer whose distinguished career was
scarcely less illustrious than that of his more celebrated
brother. He was born at Flushing in 1761,
and died at Plymouth in 1832. His ship, the <i>Amphion</i>,
of 32 guns, blew up in the Hamoaze, Plymouth, on
22nd September, 1796, and only her commander and
a few others escaped with their lives.</p>

<p>Once again the distasteful 'piping times of peace'
came round; and Pellew, for want of something to
do, turned farmer. His experiments in this capacity
were made on the little family estate of Treverry, near
Falmouth; but they were a failure; and the declaration
of war against France, in February, 1793, promised
him a most agreeable relief after his enforced
idleness. He was appointed to the <i>Nymphe</i> (formerly
a French frigate) of 36 guns; and, to Cornishmen at
least, his connexion with this ship&mdash;manned as she
was for the most part by Cornish miners, eighty of
whom joined her at Spithead&mdash;is one of the most
interesting parts of his career. On the evening of
19th June, 1793, the <i>Nymphe</i> came up with the
French frigate <i>Cleopatra</i>,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> of 40 guns, and after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
furious cannonade of three-quarters of an hour, the
Cornish crew, most of whom had certainly smelt
powder before (underground), though none had ever
before heard a cannon fired, had the proud delight of
seeing the enemy's pennant hauled down, and of capturing
the first frigate in the war,&mdash;thus illustrating
Drayton's lines in his 'Barons' Warres':</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'For courage no whit second to the best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Cornishmen, most active, bold, and light.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">For this action Pellew was knighted ten days afterwards.
The Portsmouth correspondent of the <cite>Gentleman's
Magazine</cite>, writing in July, 1793, of this engagement,
says that 'the commencement of the action
between the <i>Nymphe</i> and <i>Cleopatra</i> was the most
notable and awful that the naval history of the world
ever recorded. The French captain ordered his ship
to be manned, and, coming forward on the gangway,
pulled off his hat, and called out, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Vive la nation!"</span>
when the ship's company gave three cheers. Captain
Pellew, in like manner, ordered his men from quarters
to the shrouds, and gave three cheers to "Long live
King George the Third!" and his putting on his hat
again was the signal for action, one of the most desperate
ever fought.' The captain of the <i>Cleopatra</i>, Citoyen
Mullon, was buried in Portsmouth churchyard.</p>

<p>In January, 1794, he joined the <i>Arethusa</i>, which
formed one of the cruising frigates of the Western
Squadron, a branch of the service which our hero
may be said to have originated. In the engagement
between the small French and English squadrons on
23rd April, 1794, off the Isle of Bass, he captured the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
<i>Pomone</i>, a larger vessel than his own, and carried her
into Portsmouth harbour, on which occasion Pellew
received the warmest thanks of the First Lord of the
Admiralty, and of Earl Howe. Another French
squadron was, in the following August, driven ashore
near Brest, by Pellew and his brave companions in
arms; and the Channel was thus practically cleared
of the enemy's cruisers for a while. But the following
October saw the Frenchmen once more on the
move; and it was not until after a smart engagement
off Ushant between the <i>Artois</i> and the large French
frigate <i>Révolutionnaire</i>, on which occasion Pellew commanded
the squadron, that the French navy was
completely cowed.</p>

<p>On the 2nd January, 1795, private intelligence
having reached Sir Edward that the enemy's fleet,
consisting of thirty-five sail of the line, thirteen
frigates, and sixteen smaller vessels, had put to sea
from Brest, he set forth from Falmouth with his
little squadron of five ships to reconnoitre; but no
engagement resulted from this expedition.</p>

<p>He now joined the <i>Indefatigable</i>, which he successfully
insisted upon having cut down and rigged after
his own method. She sailed from Falmouth on 2nd
March; and shortly after, the squadron of which she
formed part captured fifteen out of a convoy of
twenty-five vessels near the Penmarcks rocks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The scene now shifts to Plymouth Sound, where
he performed, on 26th January, 1796, one of the
most heroic acts that it has ever fallen to the lot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
man to accomplish. He was in evening dress, and
on his way to a dinner-party, when he heard that a
large ship, an East Indiaman, the <i>Dutton</i>, was on
the rocks under the citadel, and that no one was
able to go to her assistance; but, with his usual
hardihood, he swam out to her through the surf,
and thus became the means of saving the lives
of between 500 and 600 of his fellow-creatures.
This service he performed at the imminent risk of
his own life, and when, as we have seen, no other
witness of the wild scene had the courage to make
the attempt. For his gallant conduct on this
memorable occasion he was created a baronet, as
Sir Edward Pellew, of Treverry. The Corporation
of Plymouth voted him the freedom of their town,
and the merchants of Liverpool presented him with a
service of plate. The civic wreath and the stranded
ship which appear as honourable augmentations on
his coat-of-arms were derived from this event.</p>

<p>On the 20th April following, our sailor was again
at sea, and the action was fought between the <i>Indefatigable</i>
and the <i>Virginie</i>, which ended&mdash;as usual
with Pellew&mdash;in victory. 'He takes <em>everything</em>!'
said the brave French Captain Bergeret, weeping
bitterly as he surrendered his sword to his opponent.</p>

<p>November, 1798, witnessed the well-known futile
descent of the French upon Ireland. In the ineffectual
steps taken by the British fleet to prevent it,
Pellew had no share beyond watching Brest, and
reporting progress. But in January, 1799, he fell in
with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Droits de l'Homme</i>, and, in the midst of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
furious gale, and after an engagement of eleven
hours (during the latter part of which the <i>Indefatigable</i>
was assisted by the <i>Amazon</i>, Captain Reynolds),<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
the French ship was driven on shore in the Bay of
Audierne. The <i>Amazon</i> was also wrecked, and the
<i>Indefatigable</i> herself had a narrow escape.</p>

<p>The capture of a few privateers is all we now
have to chronicle until we hear of Sir Edward making
the daring proposal of attacking with a few frigates
the whole of the French fleet then in harbour at
Brest; but, whether from timidity on the part of the
Admiralty, or, as was suggested, from the jealousy of
Pellew's superior officer, Lord Bridport, the offer was
declined.</p>

<p>The <i>Impetueux</i>, one of his captures from the French,
was his next ship; and in her, at Bantry Bay, he
promptly quelled a mutiny, which, but for his courage
and sagacity, would probably have extended to other
ships, whose disaffected crews, demoralized by the
reports of the mutinies at Spithead and the Nore,
were, it is said, only waiting a successful result of the
rising on board Sir Edward's ship. The <i>Impetueux</i>
soon after joined Earl St. Vincent in the Mediterranean,
and formed part of the force which pursued
the combined fleets from the Mediterranean to Brest.</p>

<p>In the siege of Ferrol, August, 1800, the <i>Impetueux</i>
played an important part; but, Pellew's advice
(which seemed to Sir J. B. Warren too dangerous to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
follow) not being taken, the place was not captured;
though it was afterwards discovered that Pellew's
advice should have been followed, and that the garrison
were quite prepared to lay down their arms.</p>

<p>A short period of retirement which he spent in the
bosom of his family at Trefusis, on the shores of
Falmouth harbour, followed.</p>

<p>The year 1801 saw him nearly at the head of the
list of post-captains, and appointed a Colonel of
Marines. In the following year he was elected
Member for Barnstaple; but inactive posts did not
suit him, and at the very first moment possible he
returned to his beloved profession, being appointed
to the <i>Tonnant</i>, of 80 guns, one of the Channel fleet.
Detached from the squadron, together with the <i>Mars</i>
and the <i>Spartiate</i> and five other sail of the line, which
were placed under his orders, he blockaded the French
at Corunna and at Ferrol. But he was recalled by
the Ministry in order to support the Government
against an attack made upon their Naval Administration
by Pitt, and on Pellew's excellent speech on
this occasion the vindication of the Ministry is said
to have in a great measure depended.</p>

<p>On 23rd April, 1804, he was promoted to be
Rear-Admiral of the White, and was appointed
Commander-in-Chief in India, hoisting his flag in
the <i>Culloden</i>. Whilst on this station he was ever on
the alert for French and Dutch privateers, of most
of which the Admiral himself or his captains never
failed to give a good account, to the great advantage
of British commerce. The destruction of the enemy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
fleet at Batavia, on 2nd November, 1805, was an
expedition on a larger scale. In this Sir Edward's
son, Captain Fleetwood Pellew,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> in the <i>Terpsichore</i>,
took a prominent part; and a successful attack upon
Sourabaya, in Java, soon followed. This sums up
his Oriental experiences; and in February, 1809, he
sailed from India with a fleet of Indiamen under his
convoy, and safely arrived once more in England,
after a narrow escape during a severe gale. The
spring of the following year, 1810, saw him, on board
the <i>Christian VII.</i>, and Commander-in-Chief in the
North Sea, effectively blockading the Dutch fleet in
the Scheldt.</p>

<p>In 1811, in the <i>Caledonia</i>, he succeeded Sir Charles
Cotton as Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean
fleet, jealously watching the coast from the Ionian
Islands to Gibraltar, and striving, with the utmost
energy and success, to promote the efficiency and
welfare of all who served under him. He was present
at the capitulation of Genoa in February, 1814;
and shortly afterwards saw the termination of the
war, and the confinement of Napoleon as a prisoner
in the island of Elba.</p>

<p>Of this happy event advantage was taken by the
Government to confer on our hero the dignity of a
baron&mdash;an unexpected honour to him&mdash;and he chose
'Exmouth of Canonteign' as his title, that being an
estate which he had purchased as a family property.
He also obtained the pension usually granted for
services so distinguished as his had been (it amounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
to £2,000 a year), and the next year he received the
additional honour of being made a G.C.B.</p>

<p>He went to the Mediterranean again in 1815, on
the return of Napoleon from Elba, hoisting his flag
in the <i>Boyne</i>, with his brother, Sir Israel Pellew, as
Captain of the Fleet. Naples he rescued from
anarchy on the flight of Murat before the Austrian
army, and for this service King Ferdinand gave him
the Order of St. Ferdinand and Merit. Next he
saved Marseilles from the rebel Marshal Brune; and
finally spent the winter of this year in Leghorn roads.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The commencement of 1816 found him preparing
for what is perhaps his most celebrated exploit, viz.,
the siege of Algiers; the objects of which, it will be
remembered, were to obtain the release of all the
Ionian slaves, who, by recent political arrangements,
had become <em>British</em> subjects; and to repress the
piratical excursions of the Barbary States.</p>

<p>The preliminary reconnoitre was admirably performed
by Captain Warde, and the squadron, shortly
afterwards, set sail for Algiers, where the demand
for the release of the Christian slaves was forthwith
promised. Tunis and Tripoli followed suit; and
Lord Exmouth returned to Algiers in order to press
upon the Dey the abolition of Christian slavery.
Only evasive answers could, however, be procured;
and, having secured from the Dey a promise at least
to treat, the British Admiral returned for a short
space to England for further instructions.</p>

<p>It need scarcely be said that Mr. Osler's description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
of the siege of Algiers, the guilty 'pirate
city,' is given with all that perspicacity and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text 'fulness'">fullness</ins>
of detail which characterized all his literary work;
and to his account the technical reader may confidently
be referred. The formidable sea defences
alone consisted of 500 guns; and these Exmouth
proposed to attack with only five sail of the line!
Nelson is said to have named (under incorrect information,
it is true) twenty-five as the proper force; but,
at any rate, the attack of such fortifications as these
by a few ships was quite a novelty in the annals of war.</p>

<p>Joined by five frigates, four bomb-vessels, and five
gun-brigs, the fleet sailed from Portsmouth on the
25th July, 1816, practising regularly with their guns
on the voyage, and arriving before Algiers on the
26th August.</p>

<p>Very early on the following morning, after waiting
long and anxiously for the sea-breeze, which
came at last, the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, with Lord Exmouth
(now sixty-five years of age) on board, led the attack
amidst three ringing cheers from his men;&mdash;and in a
few minutes her broadsides destroyed the defences
of the Mole. It was reported that 500 Moors were
killed by the first discharge of the English guns.
The Algerines then attempted, in their gunboats, to
board the British ships; but, as soon as they were
discovered through the smoke, the heavy guns of
the <i>Leander</i> and other ships sent 33 out of the
37 which composed the flotilla to the bottom.
The enemy's ships at anchor were then fired; and
by ten at night, after a cannonade of nearly nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
hours, the town and fortifications of Algiers were in
ruins. 128 men only were killed and 690 wounded
in the British ships, and 13 killed and 52 wounded in
the Dutch squadron&mdash;losses by no means excessive
under the circumstances; the enemy's loss, which
must have been fearful, is not known. Lord Exmouth
was struck (but only very slightly wounded) in three
places; yet his coat was slit and torn by musket-balls
as if it had been slashed by a madman's scissors.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>British sailors had never fought more bravely and
determinedly, or in grimmer silence. When wadding
failed, they cut up their clothes as a substitute for it;
and even the women on board handed the shot and
shell to their husbands. The <i>Impregnable</i> and the
<i>Leander</i> suffered most from the enemy's fire; the
former was hulled by 263 shot, 209 of which were
between wind and water, and she herself discharged
6,730 round shot.</p>

<p>The next morning, the 28th of July, the Dey,
Omar Pasha, a brutal and ferocious ex-Aga of
Janissaries, whilst Algiers was in flames, and her
sea-batteries pounded into ruins, sent in his complete
submission; peace was signed under a salute of 21
guns for England, and the same for Holland; and
3,003 slaves, of whom 1,083 were Christians, and some
of whom were English, were liberated, and returned
to their respective countries.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Honours now fell thick and fast upon Lord Exmouth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
He was created a Viscount by George III.;
the Kings of Holland, Spain, and Sardinia conferred
knighthood upon him; the City of London voted
him its freedom; Oxford conferred upon him the
degree of D.C.L.; and he received the thanks of
Parliament; the letter from the Speaker, dated 3rd
February, 1817, conveying them, being as follows:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'In transmitting to your Lordship this honourable
testimony of the gratitude of your country, I cannot
withhold the expression of my own personal satisfaction
that this age of military exploits has not closed
without so splendid an increase of our naval glory;
and that the great work, of which all Christian
States had so long and justly desired to see the
accomplishment, has been performed with a display
of skill and valour which have enrolled your Lordship's
name upon the annals of the nation in the
most distinguished rank of her naval commanders.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Pellew had now attained the summit of his ambition;
and, in 1817, having been appointed to the
naval command at Plymouth,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> was instrumental in
saving from destruction the historic fortress of Pendennis
Castle, which, from motives of economy, the
Government of the day had proposed to destroy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He passed the close of his life quietly near Teignmouth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the only additional honour which was
bestowed upon him being that of his appointment,
in 1832, as Vice-Admiral of England, a post which,
however, he only filled for a few months; for, on the
23rd of January, 1833, in the seventy-sixth year of
his age, the old sea lion calmly passed away, in pious
confidence, to his rest. A brother officer who was
often with him during his last hours, said, 'I have
seen him great in battle, but never <em>so</em> great as on his
death-bed.'</p>

<p>He was buried at Christow, the parish in which
are the family mansion and estate of Canonteign;
and in the church there an elaborate marble monument
records his faith and piety, his honours and his
virtues.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are three or four good portraits of Pellew,
of which the three-quarter length by Northcote in
the National Portrait Gallery is perhaps the best.
It gives the unmistakably Cornish physiognomy of
the original, and does full justice to the determined
look of the lower part of his face. It was exhibited
at the Royal Academy Exhibition at Somerset House
in 1819, when Pellew was sixty-two years of age.
Another fine portrait is by Sir Wm. Beechy (engraved
by C. Turner), a full-length, representing
the hero on the deck of the <i>Queen Charlotte</i> at the
siege of Algiers, giving orders for furling her mainsail,
when she was in imminent danger of being set on
fire by an Algerine vessel, which was in flames
close by.</p>

<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">It</span>
 is not a little remarkable that the fame
of Samuel Foote, great as it was during
his lifetime, and for some time after
his death, has so rapidly dimmed; for he
was not only a capital mimic, a boon companion,
a most generous master to his subordinates, a
ready wit, and an accomplished actor, but he was
also a fair scholar, a bitter though an avowed satirist,
and a prolific, as well as skilled, dramatic writer and
critic. He wrote about thirty pieces for the stage
(which were translated into the German in 1796),
and the list of his works in their various editions occupies
about thirty pages in the MS. British Museum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>catalogue. His slightest sayings were carefully preserved;
and the very slightness of some of them is,
perhaps, one of the strongest evidences of the fame
which he enjoyed.</p>

<p>Foster says of him, in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> for
1854, that his writings are 'not unworthy of a very
high place in literature;' and that his name 'was
once both a terrible and a delightful reality.' And
yet, notwithstanding the amusing picture which they
present of the manners and conversation of London
a hundred years ago, they have not sufficed to
preserve his fame. Who of the rising generation
has ever read anything of Foote's besides his ever-ready
and often quoted <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon-mots</i>; or knows anything
more of his plays than has been learnt from an
occasional representation of 'The Liar' on the stage?
It is hardly necessary to inquire into the cause of
this, for the joker's reputation is proverbially fleeting.
Moreover, Foote's pieces are somewhat too slightly
constructed, depending not so much upon the plot
or the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</i> as upon such a delineation of the
various characters as seems hardly to come within
the scope of our modern actors; but, nevertheless, it
certainly does cause one to reflect how soon a man,
not without strong claims to be remembered, may
be forgotten. Yet, while he lived, his name was
in every man's mouth, and in a vast number of contemporaneous
books. 'No man,' says Baker, 'was
more courted when in the zenith of his fame: for
instance, when the Duke of York returned from
the Continent, he went first to his mother's, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
to His Majesty's, and directly from them to Mr.
Foote's.' And yet it should be well understood that
he was, withal, no toady. To the Scotch nobleman,
boasting of his old wine, which he doled out in
very small <em>glasses</em>&mdash;'It is very <em>little</em>, of its age,' said
Foote, handling his glass. He congratulated the
Duke of Cumberland on his digestion, when the Duke
said he had come for the purpose of swallowing all
Foote's good things&mdash;'for,' said the coarse wit,
'you never bring any of them up again.' And when
the Duke of Norfolk consulted him as to going to a
masquerade in a <em>new character</em>&mdash;'Go <em>sober</em>,' was
Foote's instant reply.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It will be the object of the following memoir not
only to sketch the life of the Truro wit, and to
enumerate most of his plays in chronological order,
but also to give one or two short specimens of his
powers as a writer: the difficulty on the latter point
being to make a selection from the very numerous
examples left to us. But it should always be remembered
that the parts played by Foote are, as
written, but a very faint reflexion of what he actually
uttered, often <em>impromptu</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Samuel Foote was the older of two sons of Samuel
and Eleanor Foote, of Truro. His younger brother
Edward, a clergyman, was all but an imbecile, and
in his later years depended almost entirely upon
his elder brother for support. Samuel was born,
not as is generally stated, at the Red Lion Inn,
in Boscawen Street, which was at one time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
residence of Henry Foote&mdash;a distant relation; but
'at Johnson Vivian's<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> house, near the Coinage Hall'
(now removed). So far as I can ascertain, this
house must have stood nearly opposite to the Red
Lion, on the site of the old King's Head inn,
where, Lysons says, a nunnery of Poor Clares once
stood, and close to the spot where Lemon Street
and Boscawen Street now join. Polwhele suggests
that the inscription 'I. F., 1671,' still to be seen over
the door of the Red Lion, refers to John Foote, the
dramatist's grandfather.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> His father was M.P.
for Tiverton, Mayor and Alderman of Truro, a
Commissioner of the Prize Office, and Receiver of
Fines for the Duchy of Cornwall; and had his
summer residence at Pencalenick, about a mile east
of the new city. And here it may be said that Foote
was to the last very proud of his genealogy. His
father died at 'Pednkallinick,' as his epitaph records,
on 12th March, 1754, in the seventy-sixth year of his
age, and was buried at St. Clement's, near Truro:
his grave-stone is on the east wall of the little north
transept. But the Footes had another residence in
the same parish, namely, at Lambesso, where, according
to Lysons, they were seated in the days of
Charles II. His mother was a daughter of Sir
Edward Goodere, Bart. (a descendant of the Earl of
Portland), M.P. for Herefordshire; she was a lady
of considerable vivacity, from whom Foote is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>supposed to have derived what Carlyle calls the
'aroma' of his character, rather than from his
father. She was eighty-four years of age when she
died, and 'Hesiod' Cooke (who wrote Foote's life)
says, she was as sprightly at seventy-nine as most
women are at forty. She was as thriftless as her
celebrated son himself, and he had ultimately to
grant her an annual allowance. The following letters
once passed between them:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Samuel Foote, the subject of our sketch, was
christened on 17th January, 1720, at St. Mary's
Church (on the site of the Cathedral now in progress),
and was educated first at the Truro Grammar
School, under Mr. Conon, where he was particularly
fond of his Terence, and afterwards under Dr. Miles,
at Worcester. Notwithstanding his strong propensity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
for jokes and tricks, he was a favourite with his
master, and made fair progress with his studies; and
he never failed, when visiting Truro, to call at the
old school, and, in mock-heroic style, to beg a
holiday for the boys.</p>

<p>In 1737, he was entered at Worcester College,
Oxford, which had been in 1714 founded anew by
a connexion of the Foote family,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> and worked tolerably
hard, acquiring considerable proficiency in the
lighter classical authors; but his chief delight lay in
caricaturing the Provost, Dr. Gower, and in playing
tricks upon him and the verger of the College
Chapel. One of these tricks consisted in tying a
wisp of hay to the bell-rope which hung outside the
chapel, in a lane down which certain cows went to
grass. The cows naturally snatched at the tempting
morsel, and rung the bell in a most weird manner,
to the alarm of the authorities, who determined on
sitting up to watch the rope one night in order to
discover the author of the trick played upon them.
Another of Foote's Oxford freaks is recorded by
Murphy, who says that whilst at Oxford the future
player and dramatist acted in the part of Punch.</p>

<p>Shortly after he came of age, which was in 1741,
he was entered at the Inner Temple, where he distinguished
himself chiefly by the magnificence of his
chambers, and by the smartness of his oral criticisms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
on the actors of the day, when discussing their
merits and their faults with other sparks and critics
at the Grecian, in Devereux Court, or at the Bedford
Coffee-house in Covent Garden. The dry study of
the law had little or no attraction for our volatile hero;
and Dr. Barrowby (the friend and adviser of Macklin in
his controversy with Foote's chief rival, Garrick<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>) has
thus sketched the Truro youngster for us at this period
of his life. One evening, says he, I saw a young man
extravagantly dressed out in a frock-suit of green
and silver lace, bag-wig, sword, bouquet, and point
ruffles, enter the room,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and immediately join the
circle at the upper end. Nobody recognised him;
but such was the ease of his bearing, and the point
and humour of remark with which he at once took
part in the conversation, that his presence seemed
to disconcert no one, and a sort of pleased buzz of
'<em>Who is he?</em>' was still going round the room unanswered,
when a handsome carriage stopped at the
door, and the servants announced that his name was
Foote, that he was a young gentleman of family and
fortune, a student of the Inner Temple, and that
the carriage had called for him on its way to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>assembly of a lady of fashion. Vanity was indeed to
the last one of Foote's besetting sins, and he could not
shake it off, even on the stage; for he was very greedy
of applause, and often sacrificed his fellow-actors
performances to his own ends. 'Fine feathers, however,
do not make fine birds;' and Foote must have
relied a great deal on the skill of his tailor; for he
was in person rather short and stout&mdash;exactly like
his mother&mdash;and his features were plain and coarse.
Yet, his arch smile and merry eye, preserved to us
in his likeness, when fifty years old, by Colson (engraved
by Caroline Watson), redeemed his otherwise
commonplace visage, and made him, on the whole,
not an unattractive-looking person. Zoffani also
painted two admirable portraits of him, in character;
but the best is that by Sir Joshua, now at the
Garrick Club, painted about the year 1760, when
Foote was forty years of age.</p>

<p>Two of Foote's 'three fortunes' came chiefly
through his mother, who succeeded to the Goodere
family property, said to have been worth about
£5,000 a year, in a most strange and tragic manner;
but he also inherited some property left by his
father. Mrs. Foote's elder brother Sir John, a man of
weak intellect, was entrapped on board his brother
Samuel's ship, the <i>Ruby</i>, in Bristol Roads, and was
then and there strangled by him&mdash;a crime for which
the younger Goodere was deservedly hanged.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Foote, at that time in terrible pecuniary straits&mdash;in
fact, literally a stockingless Foote, as he himself
would perhaps have said&mdash;wrote, for £20, a pamphlet,
describing the murder, and endeavouring, but vainly,
to exculpate his uncle and namesake. It was published
anonymously in April, 1741.</p>

<p>With so much wealth and popularity as he had
even thus early acquired, it is wonderful that Foote
continued his legal studies for so long a period as
three years; but, in fact, he can hardly be said to
have done this, for he had already begun to earn
money by his pen (chiefly by writing a few pamphlets),
having contrived in a couple of years, like the prodigal
of old, to 'waste all his substance in riotous living,'
and to fall into sad straits.</p>

<p>Accordingly, his connexion with the stage, to
which he seems to have been introduced by some
excellent amateur actors, his valued friends the
Delaines, now commenced, in 1743, by his taking a
share with his friend Macklin in the wooden theatre
in the Haymarket, known as 'The Little' or 'Summer
Theatre,' and 'The Hay'&mdash;the laudable and distinguishing
feature of the performances being a
<em>natural</em> mode of elocution and gesture, as contra-distinguished
from the stilted and drawling sing-song
style then in vogue (from which Foote used to think
Garrick himself was not entirely free), and at least
an attempt to dress the characters in something like
correct costume. And here it may be convenient to
observe that the title of the 'English Aristophanes,'
by which Foote came to be generally known, is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
altogether applicable to him. Foote could lay small
claim to Aristophanes' genius as a poet; whilst, on
the other hand, he never libelled his country or his
gods, as did the illustrious Greek.</p>

<p>With that strange infatuation which induces so
many born comic actors to fancy themselves tragedians,
he made his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</i> as a paid actor at the above
theatre on 6th February, 1744, as Othello; the performance
was, as might have been expected, an utter
failure, as were likewise his attempts at Shylock<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
and Pierre on other occasions. The same may be
said of his essay at genteel comedy as Lord Foppington,
in 'The Relapse.' But in the following winter
he found his true line, and appeared at Drury Lane
in the characters of Sir Paul Pliant, Fondlewife, and
Bayes; in all of which (especially in the latter) he
succeeded admirably, and his success determined
his career as that of a comic player and writer.</p>

<p>His first piece, 'The Diversions of a Morning,' in
which he himself played the part of Puzzle (intended
for Macklin<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>), was brought out at the Haymarket
in the spring of 1747; but the satire was so keenly
felt by many of the persons represented, mostly
prominent actors of the day, that, at their instance,
the magistrates withdrew Foote's license, and he
adopted an expedient which it is said had also been
employed by Garrick at the Goodman's Fields
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>Theatre, of evading the interdict of the justices by
inviting his friends to 'drink tea' with him 'at <em>playhouse
prices</em>,' and entertaining his audience with 'The
Diversions of a Morning' <em>whilst tea was getting ready</em>,&mdash;a
'tea' which never appeared.</p>

<p>This venture had what was then considered the
long run of forty representations; in fact, 'to drink a
dish of tea with Mr. Foote' became the rage of the
season. It was succeeded by a somewhat similar
performance entitled 'An Auction of Pictures,'<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
in which Foote 'knocked down' sundry worthless
persons of the day at ruinous prices, contriving
that the stage company of purchasers should make
satirical observations on the subjects of the pictures.
Peter Aretine, 'the Scourge of Princes,' says Davies,
was not more dreaded than Foote had now become;
and in this piece the satire was again so biting that
Foote made many enemies, for there was somewhat
of a vindictive character in his vein. Yet, notwithstanding,
perhaps partly in consequence of, the
coarse and furious lampoons with which he was
assailed, and of which notable specimens will be
found in Churchill's 'Rosciad,' and in Chetwood's
'General History of the Stage,' the town continued
to run after and applaud him. And here it may be
added that Polwhele records how Foote's address
and politeness had a similar soothing effect upon two
gentlemen who called to cudgel him for caricaturing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
them, to that which Incledon's singing had on a
somewhat similar occasion.</p>

<p>The same season saw the production of 'The
Knights,' in which Foote introduces the character of
Timothy, who speaks in the Cornish dialect; the performance
of this part by a Mr. Castallo was warmly
applauded. Foster says of this piece that 'it is
the first sprightly running of a wit which to the last
retained its sparkle and clearness; that its flow of
dialogue is exquisitely neat, natural, and easy; and
that its expression is always terse and characteristic.'</p>

<p>About this time, 1748, he got another windfall of
money from the Goodere estates; and, not warned
by the misery and poverty to which his previous
recklessness and extravagance had reduced him,
again went on in his old way, now setting up his
carriage with the motto 'Iterum, iterum, iterumque,'
on its panels, in allusion to his having been left a
third fortune. The story goes that the only attempt
that Foote ever made to regulate his money matters
was to keep one paying and one receiving pocket.
Four years of fast living in France dissipated nearly
all his money, and the year 1752 witnessed his
return to London, confuting by his arrival all sorts of
rumours which had been circulated as to his death
by many who had felt the sting of his whip, and
who doubtless were believing, because they hoped,
the rumours true. To these Foote alludes in the
prologue (said to have been written by Garrick)
to 'The Englishman at Paris'&mdash;his next production.</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Foote once again took the Haymarket Theatre in
1754; and, for a few nights, ridiculed Macklin's
celebrated School of Oratory, in the 'Inquisition.'<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
But he soon returned to Drury Lane, as an actor
chiefly in his own pieces, and at the same time was
occupied in preparing for publication his amusing
farce of 'The Knights.' 'The Author,' which was
successful, but which was suppressed by the Lord
Chamberlain in consequence of the severity of its
satire on Mr. Ap Reece (Cadwallader), appeared in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
1757; and, probably owing to complications arising
out of the matter, early in 1758 Foote went to
Dublin with Tate Wilkinson the mimic (who
imitated Foote himself so well, as more than once to
deceive a shrewd audience). With the same companion
Foote visited Edinburgh during the following
season, where they reaped a good harvest. It was
whilst on this occasion in Ireland that he exclaimed
of the Irish peasantry: 'I never knew before what the
English beggars did with their cast-off clothes.' In
the winter, however, the two returned to Dublin, and
here on 28th January, 1760, that clever comedy,
'The Minor,' made its first appearance, but with
indifferent success, so that Foote lost a considerable
sum of money. During his first visit to Dublin, in
January, 1758, having hung a room at his lodgings
in black, and provided himself with a dark lanthorn,
Foote disseminated hand-bills to the effect that
'there was a man to be met with at such a place who
wrote down people's fortunes without asking them
any questions.' He is said to have carried on the
deception with great success for many days, sometimes
clearing as much as £30 a day, it is said, from
his dupes. He soon after returned to London, and,
having enlarged and improved 'The Minor,' brought
it again before the public, and this time with the
most satisfactory results, the theatre closing, after
the piece had run thirty-eight nights, 'with a full
treasury.' Foster thinks its three acts are worth
almost any five that he knew. The object of the
play was to ridicule religious <em>cant</em>, and especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Whitefield, then in the height of his popularity.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
The story runs that Foote submitted the MS. to
the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Secker, with a
request that his Grace would strike out anything
that, from a religious point of view, might appear
objectionable. But the Archbishop&mdash;knowing the
sort of character he had to deal with&mdash;returned
the MS. untouched, observing that if he erased or
corrected anything, Foote would probably have advertised
the piece as 'corrected and prepared for the
press by the Archbishop of Canterbury.' 'The
Minor' elicited many sharp pamphlets and letters
against Foote, but he readily disposed of them all in
a reply which he published, replete with learning,
wit, and satire; and which contains an admirable
vindication of the Comic Muse. It has been said
that if all his other works had perished, this one letter
would have sufficed to establish his wit, scholarship,
and sense as of the rarest order; every line tells. His
defence of the course which he adopted in ridiculing
Whitefield contains the following spirited passage:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Why should I not ridicule what is done in a church
if it deserves ridicule? Is not the crime greater if
you pick a pocket at church? and is the additional
reason why a man should <em>not</em> have done it, to be the
only argument why he should not be punished for
doing it? You call profaneness an offence; you
will not have ignorant men idly invoke the name or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
attributes of the Supreme; and may not I ridicule a
fanatic whom I think mischievous because he is for
ever polluting that name with blasphemous associations&mdash;mixing
it with the highest, the meanest and
most trivial things; degrading Providence to every
low and vulgar occasion of life; crying out that he
is buffeted by Satan, if only bit by fleas, and, when
able to catch them, triumphing with texts of Scripture
over the blessing specially vouchsafed?'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Foote seems at this time to have lodged in Suffolk
Street, and to have got into several petty quarrels
with his fellow-actors, whose manners and defects he
imitated only too closely, and whose antecedents he
used to make fun of: for instance, alluding to Garrick's
having failed in his first start in life as a wine-merchant,
Foote used to say: 'I remember Davy
when he used to live in Durham Yard, and all his
stock-in-trade was three quarts of vinegar in what he
called his wine-cellar.' But such were his tact and
jolly manner, that the estrangements were rarely of
long endurance; and most, if not all of the offended
parties were, sooner or later, glad to shake hands
with the reckless mimic. He was always, however,
implacably hostile to newspaper critics&mdash;then, by the
way, a new institution&mdash;and very coarse in his remarks
upon them, although the critics generally wrote of
him with respect and praise; but it should be added
that at one time managers were almost invariably
their own critics, and the innovation was to them
most unwelcome. Nor did he think much of the
reliability of the judgment of the public. In Foote's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
'Treatise on the Passions,' he says: 'There are
12,000 playgoers in London; but not the four-and-twentieth
part of them can judge correctly of the
merits of plays or players.'</p>

<p>In January, 1762, 'The Liar,' the plot of which
was taken from the Spanish, was produced at Covent
Garden, and those who, like the writer of these
pages, have had the good fortune to see the late
Charles Mathews in the piece, will readily believe
that it was highly successful. 'The Orators' shortly
followed; it is said that it was in this piece that he
intended to introduce Dr. Samuel Johnson, and that
he was only deterred from doing so by the sturdy
Doctor's threat that, if Foote did, he would get
on the stage and soundly thrash the mimic with an
oaken cudgel. But Johnson had a real regard for
Foote and his abilities. Resolved <em>not</em> to be pleased
with him, the Doctor was compelled to give in, and
to laugh with the rest of the company that Foote was
entertaining. 'Sir,' said Johnson, 'the dog was so
very comical that he was irresistible.' Charles James
Fox thought even more highly still of Foote's conversational
powers. In fact he generally got the
better of his opponents in all verbal encounters:&mdash;but
the tables were once turned against him. He leased
the Edinburgh Theatre for 500 guineas a year&mdash;a
lawsuit arose, and Foote was defeated. The Scotch
lawyer called upon him for his bill of costs; and
on Foote's paying him the money and observing
to the lawyer that he would no doubt, like most
of his countrymen, return in the cheapest way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
possible, was drily answered: 'Yes, I shall travel
<em>on foot</em>.'</p>

<p>'The Mayor of Garrat;'<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> 'The Patron' (in which
he ridiculed the 'Enthusiasm of Antiquaries,' drawing
his friend and host, Lord Melcombe, in the
character of Sir Thomas Lofty, which Foote played
himself); and 'The Commissary' (in which the Duke
of Newcastle figured as Matthew Mug), followed
'The Orators' at the Haymarket in rapid succession,
bringing Foote considerable profit, and his
worldly success now seemed assured. But early in
1766, a sad accident whilst hunting (when he broke
his leg) marred his prospects, and embittered the
close of his career. Amputation above the knee was
pronounced necessary, and, though this was, of
course, before the days of chloroform, he bore the
terrible operation with remarkable fortitude, and
could not, even then, resist the temptation to joke,
begging the surgeons to deal gently with him, as
it was his 'first appearance in the character of a
patientee'&mdash;an allusion which will presently be made
apparent. From this time he always wore, and
played in, a cork leg. It was pitiable, O'Keefe remarks,
to see Foote leaning sorrowfully against the
wall of his stage dressing-room while his servant
dressed this sham leg to suit the character in which
his master was to appear; but in an instant resuming
all his high comic humour and mirth, he hobbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
forward, entered the scene, and gave the audience
what they expected, their fill of laughter and delight.</p>

<p>The Duke of York, with whom Foote seems to
have been a favourite, now procured for him a Royal
Patent for a summer theatre, thus enabling him to
keep it open between the 14th May and the 14th
September; and in May, 1767, the old theatre having
been pulled down, and a new one erected in its
stead, Foote appeared, as <em>Himself</em>, in 'An Occasional
Prelude,' concluding with the following not ungraceful
allusion to his Royal Highness's timely succour in
the hour of misfortune:</p>

<p>'Consult,' he says, referring to the audience on the
opening night:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Consult with care each countenance around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not one malignant aspect can be found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To check the Royal hand that raised me from the ground.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The 'Devil on Two Sticks,' an excellent little
piece, which appeared in 1768, and which ran for a
whole season, is said to have brought Foote some
three or four thousand pounds! This play is a satire
on medical quackery. Amongst others caricatured
was Sir William Browne, 'whose wig, coat, and
contracted eye firmly holding an eye-glass, and his
remarkably upright figure were all there; but the
caricaturist had forgotten Sir William's special
characteristic&mdash;his muff, which the good-tempered
doctor sent to Foote, to make the figure complete!'</p>

<p>But, 'lightly come, lightly go;' Foote could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
keep money as easily as he could earn it; and, on his
way once more to Ireland, he fell in with some blacklegs
at Bath, to whom he lost all his money; so that
he was 'ruined once more,' and actually had to
borrow £100 in order to complete his journey.
The 'Devil on Two Sticks,' however, took as well
in Dublin as it had done in London; Foote was
again rehabilitated, and was received with great
favour at the Castle.</p>

<p>His play 'The Lame Lover,' produced in London
in 1770, did not prove a success; it was followed,
in 1771, by the 'Maid of Bath;' and by the 'Nabob'
in 1772. But the 'Primitive Puppet-show,' or
rather 'Piety in Pattens,' in which the 'Puppet-show'
was introduced, brought crowded houses to
the Haymarket in 1773; it was performed by wooden
puppets nearly as large as life. In the prologue,
spoken by Foote <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in propriâ personâ</i>, and in a scarlet
livery, as was the practice with the theatrical
managers of the time, he says: 'All <em>our</em> actors are
the produce of England ... to their various families
you are, none of you, strangers. We have modern
patriots made from the box&mdash;it is a wood that carries
an imposing <em>gloss</em> and is easily <em>turned</em>; for constant
lovers we have the encircling ivy; crab-stocks for old
maids; and weeping-willows for Methodist preachers;
for modish wives we have the brittle poplar; their
husbands we shall give you in hornbeam;' and so on.
In this piece he ridiculed 'Sentimental Comedy;' it
was not one of his most successful productions;
but the 'Exordium' was very clever, and is given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
entire in the <cite>Town and Country Magazine</cite>, vol. v.,
p. 319.</p>

<p>'The Cozeners' appeared in 1774, with a prologue
written by Garrick, to whom Foote was again reconciled,
after a quarrel caused by Garrick's refusing to
lend his successful but impecunious friend the
sum of £500. 'The Cozeners' fairly enough caricatured
Mrs. Grieve as Mrs. Fleecem&mdash;a woman
who extorted money from her victims by promising
to procure for them Government appointments.
Now, Foote himself was generally thought to have
obtained an annuity from Sir Francis Delaval, by
bringing about a marriage between him and Lady
Nassau Powlett, with whom Foote had been very
intimate. It was, however, too bad of Foote to
caricature, under the name of Mrs. Simony, the
widow of the Rev. Dr. Dodd, then only recently
hanged. But Foote's aims were really not lofty; he
sought, as Dr. Doran says, less to reform vice and
folly than to produce amusement (sometimes unscrupulously
enough), by holding them up to ridicule.
And here it must be observed that, although he was
thin-skinned, and not over-courageous, yet Davies
wrote of him: 'There is hardly a public man in
England who has not entered Mr. Foote's theatre
with an aching heart, under the apprehension of
seeing himself laughed at.'</p>

<p>The following year saw Foote involved in one of
the most disastrous and disagreeable events of his
life&mdash;namely, his prosecution at the instance of the
profligate Duchess of Kingston, whom Foote had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
prepared to lampoon in a little piece called 'A Trip
to Calais,' in respect of her then approaching trial
for bigamy, when she was found guilty by the House
of Peers. The Duchess's influence, however, prevailed
to prevent the appearance of the piece, and
the Lord Chamberlain's license was withheld; and
correspondence of a most virulent nature between
Foote and the Duchess ensued. It was on this
occasion that Foote penned the following defence of
his writings: 'During my continuance in the service
of the public I never profited by flattering their
passions, or falling in with their humours. In exposing
follies I never lost my credit with the public,
because they knew I proceeded <em>upon principle</em>.' The
Duchess tried to <em>buy</em> off her persecutor, but in vain;
attacks on each side, of the grossest and most
virulent nature, now appeared in the papers; and an
expensive prosecution of Foote on a foul but
imaginary charge, by one Jackson,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> was instituted;
but Lord Mansfield summed up in Foote's favour,
and the result was his immediate and honourable
acquittal (the jury not even turning round in the box
to consider their verdict). The worry and anxiety
attendant upon so abominable a persecution shattered
Foote's health and spirits, and unfitted him
for awhile for appearing again on the stage. He
accordingly sold his patent, including the theatrical
wardrobe and leave to perform any of Foote's unpublished
plays, to George Coleman, for £1,600<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
a year; and he only went on the stage thrice afterwards.</p>

<p>During the quarrel with the Duchess of Kingston
Foote had bitterly satirized some of her worthless
creatures in a piece called 'The Capucin'&mdash;the last
that he ever wrote except 'The Slanderer,' which,
however, he left unfinished at his death.</p>

<p>In May, 1777, he made another attempt to appear
on the stage; but illness and anxiety had made fearful
havoc with his looks and his gaiety; and a
paralytic stroke whilst acting in his own piece, 'The
Devil on Two Sticks,' put an end for ever to his stage
performances. He retired to Bath, and there his
health and sprightliness somewhat recovered; but it
was only a flickering of the expiring candle in its
socket. The doctors advised him to try Paris, and
thither, from his house in Suffolk Street, Pall Mall,
he proceeded, by way of Dover, in the following
October, with a presentiment that he should never
return to Town alive. It was here, whilst waiting
at the Ship Inn for a favourable passage, the conversation
occurred with the cook-maid, and probably
Foote's very last jokes, without which no account of
him seems to be considered complete. The woman
was boasting that <em>she</em> had never left <em>her</em> native place,
when Foote retorted by saying that he had heard
upstairs that she had been 'several times all over
Greece,' and that he himself had seen her at 'Spithead.'
On the following day, the 21st October, 1777,
he had another paralytic seizure, and was no more.
On the 3rd November he was buried by torch-light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
in the west cloister of Westminster Abbey.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> No
stone marks his resting-place; but there is an epitaph
to his memory at St. Mary's, Dover, of which the
following is a copy:</p>

<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">Sacred to the memory of<br /></span>
<span class="i18"><span class="smcap">Samuel Foote, Esq.</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i16">Who had a Tear for a Friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i14">And a Hand and Heart ever ready<br /></span>
<span class="i16">To Relieve the Distressed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He departed this life Oct. 21st, 1777 (on his journey to France),<br /></span>
<span class="i18">at the Ship Inn, Dover,<br /></span>
<span class="i22">aged 55 years.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This inscription was placed here by his affectionate Friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i20">Mr. Wm. Jewell.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He left, besides portraits and small legacies to
sundry of his friends, the bulk of the property remaining
to him to his two natural children, Francis
and George; and I may here observe that, notwithstanding
Cooke's positive statement that Foote
married a Worcestershire lady, and that shortly after
the wedding he took her to his father's house at
Truro; and Polwhele's dictum that he married Miss
Polly Hicks, of Prince's Street, Truro&mdash;(she is said
to have been sixteen and Foote eighteen when they
married, but she died early of consumption)&mdash;I have
been unable to discover with certainty whether or
not he was ever really married. Certainly, no Mrs.
Foote ever appeared upon the scene when he lived at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>'The Hermitage,' North End, between Fulham and
Hammersmith (to which place he had moved from
Parson's Green, where Theodore Hooke afterwards
lived). Here he used to be very fond of entertaining
his friends, amongst whom were many members of
the nobility, and occasionally even royal personages,
with his usual wasteful extravagance. There is a
story of his having been 'reconciled' to his wife
whilst he was living at Blackheath; and another
story of his old fellow-collegian Dr. Nash, the historian
of Worcestershire, having called to see him
when confined for debt in the Fleet Prison, and finding
a supposed Mrs. Foote hiding somewhere in the
room; but there are, I believe, no proofs positive of
the reckless, dissipated subject of this memoir having
ever submitted to the marriage tie.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> for 1777 says of him
that 'As no man ever contributed more to the entertainment
of the public, so no man oftener made the
minds of his companions expand with mirth and
good-humour; and in the company of men of high
rank and superior fortune, who courted his acquaintance,
he always preserved a noble independency.
That he had his foibles and caprices no one will pretend
to deny; but they were amply counterbalanced
by his merit and abilities, which will transmit his
name to posterity with distinguished reputation.'</p>

<p>We commenced this article by considering how
fleeting this reputation was; yet still it is strange that
in this case it has died from amongst us so soon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Garrick said of Foote that he was a man of wonderful
abilities, and the most entertaining man he had
ever known; and this was a tribute from a rival
manager and actor, be it remembered. Fox, eminent
conversationalist as he was, said that whatever was
the subject of conversation, 'Foote instantly took
the lead, and delighted us all.' Davies, Tate Wilkinson,
and Horace Walpole joined in the chorus
of his praise; and even Dr. Samuel Johnson, who
perhaps feared Foote as much as he disliked him,
admitted that he was a scholar, that his humour was
irresistible, and that he could drive any of his rivals
out of the room by the sheer force of his wit. The
remarks of Sir Walter Scott and Lord Macaulay fall
flat after such tributes as the above; and they are
probably to be explained by the fact that they never
came within the range of the personal influence of the
man&mdash;without having done which they can hardly be
considered competent judges of so amusing an actor,
and such an invariably ready, courageous wit and
satirist as was Samuel Foote.</p>

as Davies says, 'ran a-tilt at everybody, and was at the same time
caressed and feared, admired and hated by all,' never failed to launch
the shafts of his satire against Garrick, who was obliged to sit dumb in
his presence. It has been said that while the wit of the one shone like
a star, that of the other blazed like a meteor: yet the two often dined
with each other.</p></div>

forgotten by both parties, which used to take place between Foote and
Macklin. Thus, on one occasion, in order to test Macklin's boast as to
his retentive memory, Foote ran off the well-known nonsense story:
'So she went into the garden to cut a cabbage-leaf to make an apple-pie,'
etc. Macklin broke down in his attempt to remember them, but
the lines themselves have since formed, on more than one occasion, the
test of a scholar's power in turning them into Latin or Greek verse;

majors, and other officers, both military and
civil, as scarce any other family this country hath
afforded; which I do not mention (for that my
great-grandmother on the one side, the wife of Sir
John Arundell, of Tolverne, knight, was daughter of
Sir Francis Godolphin, knight, sheriff of Cornwall,
21st Elizabeth), but as their just character and merit;
and I challenge the envious justly to detract from
the same.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>Without stopping to inquire whether or not Hals's
great-grandmother was not Ann the <em>sister</em> of Sir
Francis Godolphin (instead of his daughter), that
gossiping historian's claim on behalf of his ancestry
may at once be conceded; indeed, it is very singular
that he did not specify one of the family who lived
much nearer his own time, and whose illustrious
name makes those of the other Godolphins 'pale
their (comparatively) ineffectual fires.' We shall,
however, come to treat in his proper place of Sidney
Godolphin, the friend of Marlborough, the trusted
Prime Minister (for so he might be called) of James
II., of William III. and of Anne, and for many years
the moving though almost silent spirit of English
politics.</p>

<p>It will be convenient to commence our remarks
by a description of the family seat where they had
settled for so long a period that Colonel Vivian,
in his genealogical table, has been obliged to commence
the pedigree with John, Lord of Godolphin,
'sans date;' but probably he flourished about the
time of Henry III. or Edward I.</p>

<p>Godolphin, which gives its name to a high hill
about half-a-mile to the south-west of the house, is
situated in the parish now called Breage; and in the
parish church, so named after the Irish St. Breaca,
as well as in numerous other churches and churchyards
of western Cornwall,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> lie the bones of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
a Godolphin, while their helmets&mdash;one of them surmounted
by the 'canting' crest of a <em>dolphin</em>&mdash;hang
rusting 'in monumental mockery' over some of the
tombs. The remains of the mansion (now occupied
as a spacious and comfortable farmhouse), the
many roads of approach to it, the antique gardens,
and the broad, terraced hedges, still testify to its ancient
importance. For a place of much consideration
it evidently was, even down to the time of Sidney
Godolphin, and later. Those were days when the
only newspaper which came to so remote a corner of
England&mdash;and which was procured weekly, together
with his despatches (whilst he was in Cornwall),
by the Lord Treasurer's own special messenger to
Exeter&mdash;lay on the table in the hall at Godolphin,
now called the King's Room, for the benefit of
the neighbouring clergy and gentry. Dr. Borlase
gives a more or less conjectural view of the house in
its glory, surrounded by its park and groves; and
what is supposed to have been a view of it was found
on a panel in Pengerswick Castle; but its glories
have long departed. Yet, although Godolphin has not
vanished from off the face of the earth, like Killigrew,
the early abode of the Killigrews in St. Erme, and the
two Stows, the residence of the Grenvilles of Kilkhampton,
sufficient remains to indicate to the passerby
that here may once have lived a family as distinguished
as that to whom Hals so proudly refers.
The surface of the surrounding landscape is now
scarred by mines and clay-works; and the little
stream, crossed just below the house by Godolphin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
Bridge, is discoloured by mine-refuse, disfiguring
instead of beautifying the scene.</p>

<p>'No greater Tynne Workes yn al Cornwal then be
on Sir Wylliam Godolcan's ground,' wrote Leland,
and his statement long held true. It was remarked
by the late W. J. Henwood in 1843, that in eighteen
years Wheal Vor, an adjacent mine, had raised tin
to the value of a million and a quarter sterling, of
which £100,000 was profit to the adventurers. To
be a steward of the Godolphins was held to be a sure
method of attaining wealth and influence; indeed,
there is a humorous story told of one of the Godolphin
ladies' excusing her late appearance at the
dinner-table one day by saying that she had been
down to the smelting-house 'to see the cat eat the
dolphin;' the allusion being to the respective marks
on the Godolphin tin and that smelted at the same
time by Coke, the steward, who bore <em>cats</em> on his coat-of-arms.
The Godolphin of the period thereupon introduced
some much-needed reforms in the management
of his tin business.</p>

<p>About a mile to the south of the house, and rising
nearly 600 feet high&mdash;a considerable elevation in
western Cornwall&mdash;rises Tregoning (or more properly,
Treconan) Hill&mdash;the dwelling of Conan&mdash;from
whose summit, looking to the south-west, the eye
commands a vast stretch of waters, over which the
sailor might pass to the West Indies without seeing
land, unless he chose to touch at the Azores.
Nearer at hand, and seeming almost under our
feet, lie the noble curves of the Mount's Bay, with,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
for a central feature, the rocky islet&mdash;'both land
and island twice a day,' as Carew says&mdash;on which
stand the Castle and Chair of St. Michael&mdash;'Kader
Mighel'&mdash;still looking</p>

<p class="center small">'Tow'rd Namancos and Bayonas' hold.'</p>

<p>Turning our gaze towards the north-west, we
see sapphire waves roll on the golden sands which
fringe the shores of St. Ives Bay; and, towards
the west, the Land's End district so melts into
the grey haze of the Atlantic, that it would be
as hard to say where the land ended and the sea
began, as it would be now to gather the whole
truth as to the lost land of Lyonesse, traditionally
reported to have been submerged between Bolerium
and the Isles of Scilly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such were the surroundings of Godolphin. The
building itself, originally a castle or fortified residence
of some sort, was in ruins in the days of
Edward IV. William of Worcester, in 1478, says
of it:</p>

<p>'Castellum Godollon dirutum in villa Lodollon';
and Leland, in the days of Henry VIII., describes
it in the following words:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Carne Godolcan on the Top of an Hille, wher
is a Diche, and there was a Pile and principal Habitation
of the Godolcans. The Diche yet apperith,
and many Stones of late Time hath beene fetchid
thens. It is a 3 Miles from S. Michael's Mont by
Est North Est.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>Rebuilt as Godolphin Hall in the days of Elizabeth,
it appeared as a quadrangular mansion, with a fine
portico of white granite along the north front, constructed
by Francis, the second Earl; but this was
the last flickering of its lamp. The rooms over
the portico were, it is said, never fitted up, and the
mansion of the Godolphins is now occupied by Mr.
Rosewarne, a zealous guardian of its crumbling
walls.</p>

<p>Concerning the etymology of the name there has
been much dispute. Some have claimed for it a
Phœnician origin, and said that the word signifies 'a
land of tin'&mdash;certainly a not inappropriate derivation.
Hals is not very dogmatic (as he often is) as
to the meaning. He thinks it may mean 'God's
Downs,' an 'altogether wooded down or place of
springs,' and utterly repudiates Carew's suggestion
that it means 'a white eagle.' Others have suggested
'Goon Dolgan'&mdash;Dolgan's Down. This, at least, is
clear, that the name, as applied to persons, has had
more than one narrow escape of becoming extinct.
Once, towards the close of the fourteenth century, or
early in the fifteenth century, when Ellinor Godolphin
married John Rencie; but her husband assumed
the patronymic of his wife. Up to that time,
and, indeed, for many generations afterwards, we
constantly find the Godolphins intermarrying with
good old Cornish families, many of whom are now
extinct. I find in their family tree such names
as Trevanger, Trewledick, Antrewan, Prideaux,
Tremrow, Carminowe, Erisey, Bevill, Killigrew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
Trenouth, Cararthyn, Carankan, Tredeneck, Pendarves,
Carew, Grenville, Arundell, St. Aubyn, Boscawen,
Hoblyn, Molesworth, etc. In short, there are
very few Cornish families of any distinction in whose
veins the blood of the Godolphins of Godolphin did
not mingle.</p>

<p>The first Godolphin of note (although, according
to Lipscombe, they came in with the Conqueror)
would seem to have been one who also bore the ill-omened
name of Knava; and who, in 1504, was, as
Hals tells us, 'struck Sheriff' of Cornwall. King
Henry VII., Hals goes on to say, 'declared his great
liking of that gentleman in all circumstances for the
said office, but discovered as much dislike of his
name after the English,&mdash;not understanding the
import thereof in Cornish,&mdash;and so further said,
that as he was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pater patriæ</i>, he would trans-nominate
him to Godolphin, whereof he was lord; and accordingly
caused or ordered that in his letters-patent
under the broad seal of England, for being Sheriff of
Cornwall, he should be styled or named John Godolphin
of Godolphin, Esq<sup>re</sup>, and by that name he
accounted at the year's end with that King for his
office in the exchequer, and had his acquittance from
thence, as appears from the record in the Pipe office
there.' Another Cornish gentleman who bore the
name of Erisey was, it will be remembered (see the
story of the Killigrews), also considered, by James I.,
to be unfortunate in his patronymic; but in his case
the family name remained unchanged until it became
extinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>Sheriff John's son, Sir William, Vice-Warden of
the Stannaries, was also sheriff of the county in the
reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Elizabeth.
He was a warrior of note, and a favourite of bluff
King Hal, 'who,' Polwhele says, 'for his services
conferred on him the honor of knighthood, and
constituted Sir William warden and chief steward of
the Stannaries. He lived to a great age, and was
several times chosen one of the Knights of the Shire
for Cornwall in the Parliaments of Henry VIII. and
Edward VI. He likewise acquired much fame by
his conduct and intrepidity in several military commands,
particularly at the siege of Bologne.' Carew
ranks Sir William among the Worthies of Cornwall,
saying: 'He demeaned himself very valiantly beyond
the seas; as appeared by the scars he brought
home; no less to the beautifying of his fame, than
the disfiguring of his face.' Thomas Godolphin, his
brother, was also present at the above-named siege,
'and on Thursday, the 14th August, 1544, he, Mr.
Harper, and Mr. Culpepper were hurt with one shot
from the town.'</p>

<p>Whether it was this Sir William, or his son (who
bore the same name and title), who distinguished
himself by his 'valiant carriage' against the Irish
rebels towards the close of Elizabeth's reign, is not
quite clear; but I am inclined to think it must have
been the latter, as the first Sir William was gathered
to his fathers in the year 1570, and was buried at
Breage.</p>

<p>It was the former Sir William's brother Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
who took for his first wife a Grenville, and from
them descended, for three generations, those Godolphins
who probably led happy lives&mdash;for (so far as I
am aware) they have 'no history'&mdash;and whose
Christian name at least would imply their peaceful
careers,&mdash;for there were three Gentle Godolphins in
succession. But from Thomas's second union, with
Katherine Bonython, sprang the more famous members
of the family. One of these was Sir Francis,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
Vice-Warden of the Stannaries, who was knighted in
1580: he was with his father and uncle at Boulogne,
and was the contemporary and friend of Richard
Carew, whom he helped in writing the 'Survey of
Cornwall.'</p>

<p>Carew thus refers to his colleague:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'This Hill (Godolphin) hath, for divers descents,
supplied those gentlemen's bountiful minds with
large means accruing from their tin-works, and is
now possessed by <em>Sir Francis Godolphin</em>, knight,
whose zeal in religion, uprightness in justice, providence
in government, and plentiful house-keeping,
have won him a great and reverent reputation in
his country; and these virtues, together with his
services to Her Majesty, are so sufficiently known to
those of highest place, as my testimony can add
little light thereunto: but by his labours and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
<em>inventions</em><a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> in tin matters, not only the whole country
hath felt a general benefit, so as the several owners
have thereby gotten very great profit out of such
refuse works, as they before had given over for unprofitable;
but Her Majesty hath also received
increase of her customs by the same, at least to the
value of £10,000. Moreover, in those works which
are of his own particular inheritance, he continually
keepeth at work 300 persons, or thereabouts; and
the yearly benefit, that out of those his works accrueth
to Her Majesty, amounteth, communibus annis, to
£1000 at least, and sometimes to much more.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>And there is one other little episode of Cornish
history with which the name of Sir Francis Godolphin
will always be associated: the repulse of the
Spaniards from Penzance in 1595.</p>

<p>There was an old Cornish prophecy which ran thus:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ewra teyre a war meane Merlyn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ara Lesky Pawle Pensanz ha Newlyn,'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>
<p class="noindent">signifying that there should land upon the rock of
Merlyn (at Mousehole), those that would burn Paul
Church, Penzance, and Newlyn. And so it fell out
that, during a fog, at dawn on the 23rd July, four
Spanish galleys landed 200 men, armed with pike
and shot, who burnt all the houses at Mousehole as
they passed, and at length set fire to Paul Church
itself. The peaceable inhabitants, being then only
about 100 in number, and 'meanly weaponed,' as
Carew says, 'fled on the approach of the buccaneers,
but were rallied by Sir Francis Godolphin on Penzance
Western Green, and proceeded to attack the
enemy, who, however, managed to regain their boats,
in which they now anchored off another little fishing-village&mdash;Newlyn.
Here they landed 400 pike and
shot, and marched upon Penzance, Sir Francis endeavouring
to intercept them. But the flanking fire
from the galleys was too galling for the poor Cornish
folk, and (though none were seriously hurt) they
gave way, dispersing in various directions, and some
of them flying into the town of Penzance. At the
market-place, which is in about the centre of the
town, Sir Francis ordered them to make their stand&mdash;'himself
staying hindmost, to observe the enemy's
order, and which way they would make their approach:'&mdash;but
only about a dozen men could be got
together, and Sir Francis had to take to flight, the
Spaniards setting fire to Penzance also, and then
again returning to their galleys. Meanwhile, the
story of the attack got wind, and increased numbers
of Cornishmen assembled on the open spaces near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
Marazion, when they drove the Spanish galleys
from the shore. Succours from Plymouth arrived
on the 25th July; and the English ships, having also
heard of what had happened, were on the look-out;
but a favourable breeze from the N.W. set in, and
the enemy were unluckily enabled to make good
their retreat.</p>

<p>Like his father, Sir Francis married twice: his
second wife was Margaret Killigrew, and thus he became
identified more closely than ever with Royalist
interests. The Godolphins had obtained from
Elizabeth a lease of the Scilly Isles, and more than
one member of the family had acted as a sort of
little viceroy there; 'Dolphin Town, as it is now
called, on the island of Trescaw, still bears witness
to their former sway. Here, at Elizabeth Castle,
on St. Mary's Island, Charles II. found shelter
when he sorely needed it; and from the Scilly
Isles the Godolphins and the Grenvilles conducted
many a bold exploit during the Civil War;
until at length the fleet of the Commonwealth
compelled the desperate Knights to surrender,&mdash;as
we shall see further in the history of the Grenvilles.</p>

<p>The next few years saw a great number of deaths
in the Godolphin family. Sir Francis, the Penzance
hero, died, and was buried at Breage in 1608&mdash;his
son, Sir William, following him four years afterwards.
In 1619 John, who succeeded his father as Captain
of Scilly, died too; and in 1640 the last of the
brothers, the second Sir Francis, Recorder of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
Helston, a borough with which the Godolphins kept
up a parliamentary connexion, of the old style, for
many years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The story of the Godolphins now conveniently
divides itself into two parts, viz.: first, the history
of the descendants of the above-named John; and
secondly, that of the more celebrated line which descended
from his brother Sir William.</p>

<p>John, 'Captain of Scilly,' had married a lady
bearing the singular name of Judith Amerideth, and
had by her three sons, and I think as many
daughters. Of their offspring, Sir William and John
alone claim our attention; and the former, solely on
account of his being the father of another Sir William
who was Ambassador at Madrid. The Ambassador
was one of John Locke's most intimate friends when
they were schoolboys together at Westminster, but
was 'no great scholar;' he went to Oxford, and only
got his M.A. degree by nomination of the Crown,
for, truth to tell, he was too busy about politics to
attend to his studies. In politics, however, he seems
to have achieved some distinction, for he was Lord
Arlington's secretary and right-hand man, and was
always a staunch adherent of the Stuarts. He
went to Madrid with the Earl of Sandwich, as
his 'assistant;' and Locke joined the Embassy as
secretary, through Godolphin's interest, in March,
1666.</p>

<p>He died without issue, and it was suspected that
his religious views had been tampered with in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
latter days,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> and that he had left his property to
'superstitious uses;' whereupon the Act 10 William
III. was passed for 'confirming and establishing the
administration of the goods and chattels of Sir
William Godolphin, Knight, deceased.' It recites,
that he lived at Madrid 'surrounded by Fryers,
Priests, and Jesuits, as he lay Bedrid,' and that on
the 30th March, 1696, he made a will appointing
four of such persons his 'Testamentoros,' and leaving
them legacies. The Act declares this document to
be null and void; and refuses to recognise the
clause in which Sir William declares his soul to
be 'his Universal Heir.' But the four testamentoros
were to get their legacies, and the property was
then duly allotted amongst those to whom Sir
William had intended it should be left, before he
departed from England, viz., to his brother Francis,
of Coulston, and his nephew Charles. To the poor
of Camelford he left £20, and £10 each to the poor
of Liskeard, and of St. Mabyn. The Godolphin
school at Salisbury was founded out of the proceeds
of Sir William's estate. The whole of the
details of this transaction may be read in the 'Extractum
ex extractu pacis,' preserved in the British
Museum ((514,<em>k.</em>25)/2).</p>

<p>During two or three succeeding generations, this
branch of the family continued to give Governors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
and Deputy-Governors to the Isles of Scilly,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> until
at length the male line died out, and the Godolphin
blood became perpetuated by intermarriages with,
amongst others, the eleventh Earl of Huntingdon,
and (within the last few years) by the marriage of the
Vicar of Sydenham, in Kent, the Rev. H. W. Yeatman,
with Lady Barbara Caroline Legge, daughter
of the fourth Earl of Dartmouth. At Acton Church,
near Ealing, were the tombs of Sir John Godolphin
(1679), and of his daughter and heir Elizabeth, maid-of-honour
to Queen Katharine of Braganza.</p>

<p>One is tempted to linger somewhat longer over
John 'of Doctors' Commons, Doctor of Laws,' the
third son of John and Judith Amerideth. He was
born at Godolphin, in Scilly, on 29th November,
1617, and entered at Gloucester Hall, Oxford, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
1632, taking his Bachelor's degree in 1636, and that
of Doctor in 1642-43. I believe that if he did not
at any time reside at St. Kew, in Cornwall, at least
he must have had some thoughts of doing so, for he
held, for some time, Tretawne,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> an old Jacobean seat
of the Molesworths in this parish; and he married
Honor, a lady of that old Cornish family. A granite
stone, about twelve inches square, let into the wall
of the back kitchen, and inscribed</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_371.jpg" width="200" height="90" alt="Philippa Molesworth 1620" />
</div>

<p class="noindent">commemorates the connexion of the Molesworths
with their quondam residence of Tretawne.</p>

<p>Polwhele says that Dr. John 'was at first
puritanically inclined, but afterwards took the
engagement,' and in conjunction with Dr. William
Clarke and C. G. Cock, Esq., was, in 1653,
constituted a Judge of the Admiralty. He seems to
have always had a leaning in the direction of
polemics, notwithstanding his being a member of
the legal faculty, and his having been made one of
the King's 'Advocates' at the Restoration; certainly
his works on Divinity are more numerous than those
on Law. His 'Orphan's Legacy, or Testamentary
Abridgment,' which is in three parts&mdash;the first
treating of Last Wills and Testaments, the second,
of Executors and Administrators, and the third of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
Legacies and Devises&mdash;was, no doubt, a useful hand-book
of the period; and his 'Repertorium Canonicum'
(1687)&mdash;'an abridgment of the Ecclesiastical Laws of
this Realm consistent with the Temporal: wherein
the most material points relating to such persons
and things as come within the cognizance thereof
are succinctly treated'&mdash;is a laborious attempt to
exhibit in their legal bearings the relations of Church
and State, especially asserting the King's Supremacy.</p>

<p>But probably he will be better remembered by
his 'Holy Limbeck, or a Semi-Century of Spiritual
Extractions,' and by his 'Holy Arbour' than by either
of the foregoing works, or by his '<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Synêgoros Thalassios">Συνηγορος Θαλασσιος</span>,
or a view of the Admiral's Jurisdiction.' The title of
the 'Holy Arbour' runs as follows, in the fantastical,
metaphorical style of the time:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'The Holy Arbour&mdash;contayning y<sup>e</sup> whole Body of
Divinity, or A Cluster of Spirituall Grapes, gathered

Laborers in the Lord's Viniard; Pressd For the
Spirituall delight and benefit of all such as thirst
after Righteousness.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p class="noindent">And the Dedication, in similar vein, commences thus:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'To the Truly Honorable, the Poor in Spirit.<br /><br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Right Humble,</p>

(Judg. xiv. 14) was the second course served in

not unaptly be applied to you. Came not the Spirit

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Our author died in 1678, in or near Fleet Street,
and was buried in the north aisle of St. James's
Church, Clerkenwell, leaving one son, Francis, who
died in 1695, and who was buried with his wife,
Grace, at St. Columb Major: down to within the
last hundred years their descendants have hovered
round the neighbourhood, and found like resting-place
for their remains.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We must now revert to that branch of the
family which comprises, as I have said, its more
distinguished members, and which sprang from the
union of Sir William Godolphin (who died and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
buried at Breage in 1613) with Thomasine Sidney,
of Wrighton in Norfolk, a lady who bequeathed her
maiden surname to many of her descendants down
to the present day.</p>

<p>One of their sons, Sidney, uncle of a yet more
illustrious namesake, was killed in a skirmish
during the Civil War, on Dartmoor, in February,
1643.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The Parliamentary forces had been defeated
at Boconnoc, and Hopton thereupon 'flew with a
party volant' towards Plymouth. His army, however,
received a temporary check at Chagford; but
Sir John Berkeley at length drove out the Parliamentary
forces who quartered in that little village;
and here the brave young Sidney Godolphin was
slain.</p>

<p>He was, says Clarendon, 'a young gentleman of
incomparable parts, who, being of a constitution and
education more delicate, and unacquainted with contentions,
upon his observation of the wickedness of
those men in the House of Commons, of which he
was a member, out of the pure indignation of his
soul against them, and conscience to his country,
had, with the first, engaged himself with that party
in the west; and though he thought not fit to take
a command in a profession he had not willingly
chosen, yet, as his advice was of great authority
with all the commanders, being always one in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
council of war, and whose notable abilities they had
still use of in their civil transactions, so he exposed
himself to all action, travel, and hazard; and by too
forward engaging himself in this last, received a
mortal shot by a musket, a little above the knee, of
which he died in the instant, leaving the misfortune
of his death upon a place which could never otherwise
have had a mention to the world.' And
Clarendon gives yet another and more elaborate
portrait of him ('Life of Edward, Earl of Clarendon,'
vol. i. p. 51):</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Sidney Godolphin was a younger brother of
Godolphin, but by the provision left by his father,
and by the death of a younger brother, liberally
supplied for a very good education, and for a cheerful
subsistence, in any course of life he proposed to
himself. There was never so great a mind and
spirit contained in so little room; so large an
understanding and so unrestrained a fancy in so very
small a body; so that the Lord Falkland used to say
merrily, that he thought it was a great ingredient
into his friendship for Mr. Godolphin, that he was
pleased to be man; and it may be, the very remarkableness
of his little person made the sharpness of
his wit, and the composed quickness of his judgment
and understanding the more notable. He had spent
some years in France, and in the Low Countries;
and accompanied the Earl of Leicester in his
ambassage into Denmark, before he resolved to be
quiet, and attend some promotion in the Court,
where his excellent disposition and manners, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
extraordinary qualifications, made him very acceptable.
Though everybody loved his company very
well, yet he loved very much to be alone, being in his
constitution inclined somewhat to melancholy, and
to retire amongst his books; and was so far from
being active, that he was contented to be reproached
by his friends with laziness; and was of so nice and
tender a composition, that a little rain or wind
would disorder him, and divert him from any short
journey he had most willingly proposed to himself;
insomuch as, when he rid abroad with those in
whose company he most delighted, if the wind
chanced to be in his face, he would (after a little
pleasant murmuring) suddenly turn his horse and
go home. Yet the civil war no sooner began (the
first approaches toward which he discovered as soon
as any man, by the proceedings in Parliament, where
he was a member, and opposed with great indignation)
than he put himself into the first troops
which were raised in the west for the King; and
bore the uneasiness and fatigue of winter marches,
with an exemplar courage and alacrity; until by too
brave a pursuit of the enemy, into an obscure village
in Devonshire, he was shot with a musket; with
which (without saying any word more than, Oh,
God! I am hurt) he fell dead from his horse; to
the excessive grief of his friends, who were all that
knew him; and the irreparable damage of the
public.' In fact the first Sidney Godolphin would
seem to have been a universal favourite.</p></div>

<p>In the 'Select Funeral Memorials,' pp. 10, 11, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
Sir K. J. Egerton Brydges, Bart., occurs the
following passage concerning him:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'He was a person of excellent parts, of an incomparable
wit and exact judgment, did love Hobbes of
Malmesbury, in some respects and exhibited to him,
and was entirely beloved by him, who not undeservedly
gave him this character<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> after he had
unexpectedly received a legacy from him of £200:
"There is not any virtue that disposeth a man either
to the service of God or to the service of his
country, to civil society or to private friendship, that
did not manifestly appear in his conversation, not as
acquired by necessity, or affected upon occasion,
but inherent and shining in a generous constitution
of his nature." In another place also' (p. 390, in
his 'Review and Conclusion of the Leviathan')
'Hobbes speaks thus of him: "I have known clearness
of judgment, and largeness of fancy, strength
of reason, and graceful education; a courage for
the war, and a fear for the laws, and all eminently
in one man; and that was my most noble and
honoured friend, Mr. Sidney Godolphin, who, hating
no man, nor hated of any, was unfortunately slain
in the beginning of the late civil war, in a public
quarrel, by an undiscerned and undiscerning hand,
etc."' And to the foregoing we may add that his
elegy was written by Dr. Donne.</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The following lines may serve as an example of
his ingenuity whilst, in 1623, a student at Oxford&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
it may be added that he also translated from
Virgil 'The Passion of Dido for Æneas,' which
Waller published:</p>

<p>The gallant young Sidney had a brother named
William, who was colonel of a regiment for
Charles I., and who died in 1636, aged twenty-four;
and another brother, Francis, who was knighted
at the Coronation of Charles II., in recognition, no
doubt, of the 'many acceptable remittances' which
Le Neve tells us he had made to the King when in
exile, as well as of the loyal spirit which his family
had always shown. His loyalty even displayed itself
whilst he was yet a student at Exeter College,
Oxford; as is evinced by the following copy of verses

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Sir Francis (to whom Hobbes dedicated his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
'Leviathan') was Member for the little Cornish
Borough of St. Ives in 1640. He married Dorothy
Berkeley, and had seven children, most of whom
(and <em>their</em> children likewise) were buried in Westminster
Abbey. Three only of Sir Francis's offspring
are, however, known to fame&mdash;Sir William,
created by Charles II. 552nd baronet of England,
who died unmarried in 1710, leaving £5,000 a year
to his more illustrious younger brother, the celebrated
<span class="smcap">Sidney</span>; and Henry, who became Dean of St.
Paul's and Provost of Eton, dying at Windsor in
1733. We shall get glimpses of the three brothers
in the pages of Evelyn and of Pepys. The Dean
and Sidney each married a Margaret. Dr. Henry's
spouse was his cousin, the only daughter of the first
Sidney Godolphin who fell at Chagford; while the
great Minister of State was blessed with the hand of
that sweet Margaret Blagge whose saintly fame has
been perpetuated in the pious Evelyn's 'Life of
Margaret Godolphin.'</p>

<p>Before, however, proceeding to sketch the career
of the more prominent <span class="smcap">Sidney</span>, let us look at the
memorials preserved of the good Dean. He was
the fourth son of Sir Francis, and was educated first
at Eton, and then at Wadham, and All Souls' Colleges,
Oxford. Of the latter College he became a
Fellow, and he took his degree of D.D. in 1685.
Ten years after, having been for some time Vice-Provost,
he was made Provost of Eton, of which
he was, according to Maxwell Lyte, 'a kind ruler;'
and on the 23rd of April, 1696, we find Evelyn visiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
him there, and dining with him. A few years
before, Evelyn had been to St. Albans with the two
brothers, William and Henry, to see the library of
the Archdeacon, Dr. Cartwrite: 'a very good collection,'&mdash;especially
in divinity&mdash;as might have been
expected. The party visited the Abbey&mdash;which
Evelyn calls 'the greate church,' and which, he
adds, was 'now newly repair'd by a public contribution.'
Nor had the pleasant diarist omitted to
attend on the sacred ministrations of his friend, for
we find it duly recorded that, on March 15th, 1684,
'At Whitehall preached Mr. Henry Godolphin, a
prebend of St. Paules, and brother to my deare friend
Sydnie, on Isaiah lv. 7.' On the 18th July, 1707,
Dr. Godolphin was installed Dean of St. Paul's; and
he lived long to enjoy his dignities, for he reached the
good old age of ninety&mdash;or, according to other accounts,
eighty-four. He was a most pious and charitable
man, and gave £4,000 to Queen Anne's Bounty&mdash;a
charity in which the Godolphins seem to have,
from the first, taken much interest. He was moreover,
and so were some others of his family,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> munificent
benefactors and restorers of Eton College;&mdash;the
Provost's Monument, which is on the south side of
the chapel, has a long and highly eulogistic Latin
inscription recounting his munificence and his
virtues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>Ecton, in his account of Queen Anne's Bounty
('Thesaurus Eccles.,' 4to., Lond., 1742), mentions
that Dean Godolphin gave, in conjunction with
others, 'the sum of £3,910 for the augmentation of
small livings upon the plan of that bounty.'  ... 'He
gave a £1,000 towards the alterations of the chapel
as it is at present, the which alteration (made about
the year 1700) is widely different from the original
plan given by the Founder, An<sup>o.</sup> Regni 26<sup>o.</sup> With
this money the organ, it is said, was purchased, as
being charg'd at about that sum. He adorn'd the
outer court with a statue of the Royal Founder,
cast in copper; placed on a marble Pedestal, and
fenc'd in with Iron Palisades. Further, he bequeathed
by his last Testament the sum of £200 for
the buying books to the use of the College Library.
He built the Alms Houses for 10 poor women.'&mdash;(Huggett's
MSS., Sloane, No. 4843, f. 102, 103.)
He also built, or rather rebuilt, in 1695, the extensive
brick mansion of Baylis, or Baillis, near Stoke
Pogis.</p>

<p>It was reported at the time, according to
Luttrell, that on the death of Dr. New, in 1706,
Dean Godolphin was to have succeeded him as
Bishop of Exeter, but this promotion he never
received.</p>

<p>The Provost of Eton left two sons and one
daughter. Francis, one of his descendants, and
third baron, succeeded to the title of Baron Godolphin,
of Helston, in 1766, on the death of the
second earl, when the earldom became extinct; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
as Francis Baron Godolphin died without issue in
1785, the barony also failed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But statelier figures are about to appear upon
the scene: the solemn, silent Minister, in whose
breast were locked the State secrets and intricate
policies of a succession of English monarchs, and
his devout and spotless wife, who, 'a saint at Court,'
verily walked in the flames of 'the fiery furnace, and
felt no hurt, neither did the smell of fire pass upon
her.' Of Margaret, John Evelyn's exquisite 'Life'
is familiar to many; but for her husband's career we
have to search the annals of the Courts of Charles II.,
of his brother, James, of William and Mary, and of
Anne: favoured and trusted by them all; until at
length his sturdy resistance to the growing tendency
of the last of the Stuarts to accept the counsel of
irresponsible advisers instead of that of the Ministers
of her Crown, caused the final rupture between the
Queen and her Lord High Treasurer.</p>

<p>Born about the year 1630, of great natural abilities,
educated at Oxford, and sprung from a family who
were loyal to the backbone, Sidney Godolphin, when
only about fifteen years old, was made, on the Restoration,
first Page, then Groom of the Bedchamber.
'Never in the way, and never out of the way,' as the
witty King said of him. In the following year, and
during every Parliament of Charles's reign, he sat in
the House of Commons as Member for Helston, an
old coinage-town, and then the nearest place of importance
to the family seat in Cornwall. In Parliament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
though rarely opening his mouth, he was soon
looked upon as a great authority, not only on all
questions of trade and finance, but in matters of high
policy as well. In 1668, he accompanied his brother
William on a mission to Spain. Twice, in 1678, was
he an envoy to Holland on the question of the 'separate'
peace proposed by France; and his services on
that occasion, when he received the valuable assistance
of Sir William Temple, were rewarded in the
following year by an appointment to the post of
Fourth Commissioner of the Treasury, in the room
of the Earl of Derby. It was about this time that
Pepys first became acquainted with him; and Pepys
thus records his impressions:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'February 5th, 1667-8.&mdash;Moore tells me what a
character my Lord Sandwich hath sent over of Mr.
Godolphin, as the worthiest man, and such a friend
to him as he may be trusted in any thing relating to
him in the world; as one whom, he says, he hath
infallible assurances that he will remain his friend:
which is very high, but indeed they say the gentleman
is a fine man.</p>

<p>'10th Feb<sup>y</sup>, 1667-8.&mdash;Made a visit to Mr. Godolphin
at his chamber; and I do find him a very
pretty and able person, a man of very fine parts,
and of infinite zeal to my Lord Sandwich; and one
that says, he is (he believes) as wise and able a
person as any prince in the world.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Indeed, Pepys seems to have been on intimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
terms with the Godolphins; witness the following
charming account of a dinner-party which he gave
them:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'January 23rd, 1668-9.&mdash;To the office till noon,
when word brought me that my Lord Sandwich was
come; so I presently rose, and there I found my
Lords Sandwich, Peterborough, and Sir Charles
Harbord; and presently after them comes my Lord
Hitchingbroke, <em>Mr. Sidney</em> and <em>Sir William Godolphin</em>.
And after greeting them and some time spent in
talk, dinner was brought up, one dish after another,
but a dish at a time; but all so good, but, above all
things, the variety of wines and excellent of their
kind I had for them, and all in so good order, that
they were mightily pleased, and myself full of content
at it: and indeed it was, of a dinner of about
six or eight dishes, as noble as any man need to
have, I think; at least, all was done in the noblest
manner that ever I had any, and I have rarely seen
in my life better anywhere else, even at the Court.
After dinner my Lords to cards, and the rest of us
sitting about them and talking, and looking on my
books and pictures, and my wife's drawings, which
were commended mightily: and mighty merry all
day long with exceeding great content, and so till
seven at night, and so took their leaves, it being
dark and foul weather. Thus was this entertainment
over, the best of its kind and the fullest of
honour and content to me that ever I had in my
life; and I shall not easily have so good again.'</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>
<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Shortly after his appointment to the Treasury,
Godolphin was made a Privy Councillor; and, with
the Earl of Sunderland and Mr. Hyde, formed that
triumvirate which was so greatly in the confidence of
the King:&mdash;indeed he may be said to have already become
one of the moving spirits of the age. Charles
was particularly anxious that Sidney Godolphin should
convey to the House of Commons his determination
never to consent to the exclusion of the Duke of York
from the succession; but there was an old, wise head
upon Sidney's young shoulders, and, adroitly evading
the task, Sir William Temple became his cat's-paw on
that occasion. For a few months, in April, 1684, he
succeeded Sir Lionel Jenkins, now grown very old
and infirm, as a Secretary of State; and in the
August of that year, on the retirement of the Earl
of Radnor (whom the Earl of Rochester succeeded
as President of the Council) our Sidney became First
Commissioner of the Treasury. On the 8th of the
following month, he was raised to the peerage, with
the title of Baron Godolphin of Rialton, in Cornwall.</p>

<p>Rialton is an old manor-house on the banks of
the little stream which finds its way into the sea at
St. Columb Porth. It formerly belonged to the
Priory of Bodmin, was for a long time in the
possession of the family of Munday, and was
granted to Sir Francis Godolphin in 1663. A great
part of it was destroyed by fire towards the close of
the last century, and the remains of it are now occupied
as a farm-house. It was built by the haughty
Thomas Vivian, last Prior of Bodmin, whose initials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
and arms may still be traced on various parts of the
picturesque remains: C. S. Gilbert, in his 'History
of Cornwall' (vol. ii. p. 673), gives a view of the
S.E. entrance.</p>

<p>On the accession of James II., the well-known
means by which that King essayed to bring over to
his own creed those by whom he was surrounded
were employed upon Lord Rochester, amongst others.
He was made First Commissioner, in the place of
Lord Godolphin, to whom was confided, in lieu, the
post of Chamberlain to the Queen. But James's
tactics failed; and it was not long before the skilled
financier was again at the Treasury&mdash;this time as
Second Commissioner, with, for his colleagues, two
Roman Catholic noblemen, Lord Bellasis and Lord
Dover&mdash;a conjunction which the High Church party
could not, for a long time, forgive their Protestant
colleague. What would they have said had they
known that, on the approach of the Prince of
Orange, Godolphin was the man whom James
selected to carry on his affairs during the King's
temporary absence in the west; and that to this
trusted Minister, together with the Marquis of Halifax
and the Earl of Nottingham, were confided the
proposals for an 'accommodation' which James sent
to William, at Hungerford, on December 8th, 1688?
That these proposals failed in their object is matter
of history; but it is, perhaps, not so generally known
that the exiled King, pressed for money whilst at
Rochester, was obliged to have recourse to his
Minister for a gift of a hundred guineas! He is said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
to have accompanied James to the coast, and to
have kept up a correspondence with that monarch
until his death. Sidney Godolphin was no man of
'mere abstract ideas.' He moved entirely in the
sphere of practical politics; and, notwithstanding his
intimacy with the Stuarts, and his having been one
of those who, in the Convention Parliament, had been
in favour of a Regency&mdash;perhaps, indeed, partly because
of all this&mdash;he soon found favour with the new
King of England.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Can it be believed that throughout a career so
rapid and so brilliant, the powerful Minister was
sighing for repose, and retirement to the old home
in Cornwall? Evelyn<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> assures us that such was
the case with his 'deare friend,' at any rate, during
the brief years of his happy married life. But
Margaret&mdash;his well-beloved Margaret&mdash;had died in
giving birth to Francis, their only son.</p>

<p>And now that we have seen her illustrious husband
reach the pinnacle of his ambition, we may turn for a
while to the story of his wife. She was descended
from a good family out of Norfolk,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> and her father
was a Colonel Blagge, Groom of the Bedchamber
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>to Charles I. and II. She was born on 2nd August,
1652, and reluctantly came to the court of the then
Duchess of York&mdash;Anne Hyde&mdash;when only about
fifteen years of age, leaving it for that of the
Queen on the death of the Duchess in 1671. She
was always of a pious and retiring&mdash;not to say
melancholy&mdash;disposition, and would have infinitely
preferred the quiet innocence of a country house
to the tumult and dissipation of such a Court as that
to which she was now introduced. As an instance
of the almost morbid tendency of her mind, Evelyn's
description of her attitude in the portrait which she
gave him may be cited:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'She would be drawne in a lugubrous posture,
sitting upon a Tomb stone adorned with a Sepulcher
Urne.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>An engraving of this picture is prefixed to the
edition of Evelyn to which I have just referred. It
quite embodies the spirit of Tennyson's lines to
another Margaret:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
</div>

<p>It may be easily imagined that with such a temperament
she bent her mind with extreme difficulty
to what she considered her duty&mdash;namely, to be in
the Court, and yet not of the Court&mdash;faithfully discharging
all the duties allotted to her, and preserving
a cheerful face, though her heart was aching at the
recklessness and sensuality with which she was surrounded.
And yet, says Evelyn, 'Arethusa pass'd
thro' all those turbulent waters without soe much as
the least staine or tincture in her christall; with her
Piety grew up her Witt, which was soe sparkling,
accompanyed with a Judgment and Eloquence soe
exterordnary, a Beauty and Ayre soe charmeing and
lovely, in a word, an Address soe universally takeing,
that after few years, the Court never saw or had
seen such a Constellation of perfections amongst all
their splendid Circles.'</p>

<p>But her release from her uncongenial duties was
at length, with difficulty, obtained; and she retired
to her friends, Lord and Lady Berkeley (relatives of
her future husband), at Berkeley House.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Evelyn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
writing in his usual rapturous way whenever he had
anything to say of his exquisite Margaret, gives
the following pretty picture of her flight from the
Court:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'You will easyly figure to your selfe how buissy the

her little fardle like the two daughters whom the
angell hast'ned and conducted; butt the similitude
goes no futher, for this holy Virgin went to Zoar,
they to the cave of Folly and Intemperence; there
was no danger of <em>her</em> lookeing back and becomeing a
statue for sorrow of what she left behind. All her
household stuffe, besides a Bible and a bundle of
Prayerbookes, was packed upp in a very little compass,
for she lived soe farr from superfluitye, that she
carryed all that was vallueable in her person; and tho'
she had a courtly wardrobe, she affected it not,
because every thing became her that she putt on,
and she became every thing was putt upon her.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>She afterwards moved to lodgings which Evelyn
himself built for her, 'over against his Majestie's
wood-yard in Scotland Yard,' at Whitehall; settling
here, as he says, 'with that pretty and discreete
oeconomye soe naturall to her; and never was there
such an household of faith, never Lady more worthy
of the blessings she was entering into, who was soe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
thankfull to God for them.' Her housekeeping and
the mode in which she kept her faultless accompts
are all lovingly dwelt upon; and, indeed, she seems
to have been a bright example of the Wordsworthian
line, of</p>

<p class="center small">'Pure religion, teaching household laws.'</p>

<p>At length, after many tormenting misgivings as to
whether she was justified before God in so doing,
she married Sidney Godolphin, 'that singular and
silent lover,' whose gravity and temper at Court
all knew so well, on 16th May, 1675, at the
Temple Church. The marriage was a private one,
for reasons which are by no means clear, and for
which even Evelyn can hardly quite forgive her;
though he says, 'If ever two were created for each
other, and marriages, as they say, made in heaven,
this happy paire were of the number.' Two or
three years after their marriage she was brought
to bed at Whitehall, of her first-born son, Francis&mdash;to
the great joy of herself and her husband. But
shortly afterwards a fever with alarming symptoms
set in, causing the following touching letter to be
written by her husband to Evelyn:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'My poore wife is fallen very ill of a ffevor, with
lightness in her head. You know who sayes the
prayer of the faithfull shall save the sick: I humbly
begg your charitable prayers for this poore creature,
and your distracted servant&mdash;London:&mdash;Saturday,
9 o'clock.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>The immovable man was moved to bitter agony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
now; and worse was to come: for 'sweet, pale
Margaret' soon passed away to a world more worthy
of her than that in which her lot had been cast.
Evelyn says:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'This fatall houre was (your Ladyshipp<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> knows)

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>I doubt whether there is anything more tender
and dolorous in our literature than the following
letter which she addressed to her husband&mdash;her
'deare man,' 'the husband that above all living I
vallue,' as she used affectionately to call him. The
letter was not found till after her death:</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to say that her last wish
was religiously complied with, and in Breage Church

some of his brothers and sisters, attended the

<p>While I write, I hear of an intention to dedicate
the funds collected at this year's (1881) Harvest
Festival at St. Breage, towards the cost of a spire
to surmount the church tower, in memory of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
saintly Margaret Godolphin, and her Ruth-like devotion
to her husband and her husband's people.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But to return to her solemn and now solitary
husband&mdash;who never married again&mdash;and whom we
left installed in the favour of a King almost as taciturn
as his great ancestor, or as the Minister himself.
More troubled times were at hand for him.
Party spirit, and, above all, jealousy at his rise and
his secure position close to the throne, were at
work; and we accordingly find him assailed in the
House of Commons by Hambden and others; but,
whatever he may have felt, rarely condescending a
reply. He was made Third Commissioner of the
Treasury in 1689, and First Commissioner in each
of the three following years; and, the King, on the
death of Mary his consort, going across the sea to
head the Confederate Army in the Netherlands,
Godolphin was made one of the Nine Justices for
managing the affairs of the Realm; still, however,
retaining his post at the Treasury. This state of
things continued, with slight variations, till the close
of William's reign, when the astute statesman left
his post for a while, in order, as it was supposed, to
facilitate his re-appointment on the accession of
Anne.</p>

<p>In 1702, only a few days after she ascended the
throne, the Queen made Godolphin Lord High
Treasurer of England. He accepted the post reluctantly&mdash;yet
he 'conducted the Queen,' says
Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, 'with the care and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
tenderness of a father, or a guardian, through a
state of helpless ignorance'&mdash;'the weight of affairs
now lying chiefly on his shoulders;' and those were
times when wariness and courage were as essential
as at almost any period in the history of our
country. One of his first steps was to induce Anne,
out of her somewhat scanty resources, to subscribe
£100,000 towards the expenses of the new war; to
abolish the sale of Places; and to settle her firstfruits
and tenths for the augmentation of small benefices
(the origin of the well-known Queen Anne's Bounty)&mdash;steps
which, though they of course involved
heavy pecuniary sacrifice, were highly popular with
the nation, and tended to enthrone a Queen in the
hearts of her people.</p>

<p>He was much interested in endeavouring to carry
out the Treaty for the Union with Scotland, and his
brother Charles, now M.P. for Helston, and First
Commissioner of Customs, was one of the Commissioners
appointed for the purpose; but their efforts
for the time failed; the weight of the English
National Debt, and the repugnance of the Scotch
to Episcopacy, being the main difficulties in the
way.</p>

<p>It would occupy too much space to describe in
detail&mdash;even if it were now possible to do so&mdash;the
intricate policy of Lord Godolphin and his firm friend,
the great Marlborough&mdash;another West-country man,
born at Ashe in Devonshire&mdash;at this juncture. Suffice
it to say, that the famous warrior absolutely refused
the command of our armies unless Sidney Godolphin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
was at the Treasury: he was the only man in
England, Marlborough said, on whom he could implicitly
rely for being punctually furnished with the
indispensable 'sinews of war.' Nor would it be
profitable to enter very deeply into the party politics
of the time. The difficulties which the great general
and the skilled financier had to contend with were
legion. Rochester, the Queen's maternal uncle,
had to be got rid of; and afterwards 'the careless
Harley,' who yearned to be independent of Godolphin&mdash;a
far more difficult task, and for succeeding in
which, I believe, Anne never forgave him. On this
occasion Godolphin wrote to his quondam colleague,
'I am sorry to have lost the good opinion I once
had of you; but I must believe my own senses. I
am very far from having deserved this of you. May
God forgive you for it!' The bitter feelings which
these transactions produced may be seen in the
'Secret History of Arlus (Harley),' and in John
Lydgate's 'The Beasts in Power.'<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Again, in 1705,
Charles Cæsar attacked Godolphin in the House of
Commons for keeping up, together with Marlborough
and others, a treasonable correspondence with the
Court of St. Germains; and the speaker used language
so intemperate that he was committed to the
Tower for the remainder of that session. The fact was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
that the correspondence had taken place&mdash;at least
so it has been said&mdash;with the full privity and sanction
of William, who is even reported to have expressed
his admiration of the results of Godolphin's
'coquetting' with the exiled James and his French
Court.</p>

<p>Attacks upon his consistency and his principles
all failed; for, as Bishop Burnet has observed,
'The credit of the nation was never raised so high
in any age, nor so sacredly maintained:' and so
a new mode of annoying him was invented in an
attempt to depreciate his abilities. He was thus
satirized in 'Faction Displayed':</p>

<div class="cen">

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But, notwithstanding all this, the great Minister
pursued his successful career&mdash;as a huge mastiff
passes on his way regardless of the yelping curs
at his heels. His honours increased. In 1704<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
he was made a Knight of the Garter;<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> in the
following year he was appointed Lord Lieutenant
of his native county, in the room of John, Lord
Grenville; and about the same time his son, (whose
birth, as we have seen, had cost his mother her
life,) being now seven-and-twenty years of age, became
Lord Warden of the Stannaries.</p>

<p>Congratulatory addresses were from time to time
sent up to the Throne on the success of the English
arms on the Continent. In some of them reference
is specially made to Godolphin's share in the national
triumph; and when the victory of Ramillies on the
23rd May, 1706, was celebrated, Godolphin was
selected to accompany the Queen to the thanksgiving
service at St. Paul's on the 27th of the
following month. That great battle, which caused
the French to evacuate Flanders, and secured the
best part of the Spanish Netherlands to Austria,
compelled France to offer terms of peace, which
Godolphin wisely rejected; for three or four successful
sieges were necessary in order to secure Flanders.
But this, too, like almost every other action of his
life, was afterwards brought forward by his enemies
as a charge against him. And here is perhaps a
convenient place to refer to another of his acts as a
War Minister. It will be remembered that at the
beginning of the eighteenth century all the seaboard
of America north of the St. Lawrence was in French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
possession. But in 1710 Godolphin granted six ships
and a few hundred soldiers, with a sort of general
commission, to one Nicholson, who, in May of that
year, compelled the garrison at Port Royal (afterwards
known as Annapolis) to surrender; thus acquiring
for England the whole peninsula of Nova Scotia,
and giving to the then capital of the province a name
which will always associate the place with the
memories of Queen Anne and her illustrious chief
Minister of State. It cannot be supposed from his
silence under attack&mdash;and he almost invariably held
his tongue&mdash;that he did not writhe under his
oppressors. 'Oh!' he wrote to Marlborough, 'a
slave in the galleys is in paradise compared with
me!'</p>

<p>Another object, and one worthy of the great
statesman's ambition, was at length happily accomplished
about this time&mdash;the union of England and
Scotland;<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> a matter in which he manifested unusual
zeal and activity. The Commissioners, wisely
selected by Godolphin&mdash;holding their meetings at
his official residence, which stood on the site of
Henry VIII.'s cock-pit at Whitehall&mdash;at length
happily brought it about 'to her Majesty's great satisfaction.'
It was on the occasion of giving her assent
to this Bill that Anne uttered the noble words, which
may have been penned for her by Godolphin himself,
'I desire and expect from my subjects of both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
nations that henceforth they act with all possible
respect and kindness to one another, that so it may
appear to all the world that they are heartily disposed
to become one people.'</p>

<p>It is pleasant to be able now to quote a friendly
critic, and I gladly avail myself of this opportunity
of inserting the following lines by Dr. Garth, apparently
in reply to an attack made upon Godolphin,
entitled 'Arlus and Odolphus,' in which the real
names of those alluded to are easily seen through
their thin disguise:</p>

<div class="cen">
<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ingratitude's a Weed in every Clime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It thrives too fast at First, but fades in Time.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The God of Day and your own Lot's the Same,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Vapours you have rais'd obscure your fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, tho' you suffer, and awhile retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your Globe of Light looks larger as you set.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>We must pass briefly over his share in the Occasional
Conformity Bill, in which he was said by
some to have felt in one way and voted in another;
and also his unfortunate attempt to provide for some
poor Palatines both in London and at Godolphin
Town in Scilly: at the latter place he proposed to
maintain them as soldiers for the garrison. But,
notwithstanding that the project was abandoned,
it raised a hornets' nest about his ears. Some
of his accusers (see the <cite>Medley</cite>, 11th June, 1711)
asserted that Ministers had appropriated to their
own use some of the thirty-five millions voted by
Parliament; and more than one hot-brained partizan
even clamoured that Godolphin's head should pay
the price of the maladministration of his office.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
The <cite>Weekly Examiner</cite> (No. 47) stated that the
Ministry had borrowed money at 5 per cent., whilst
they charged the unhappy creditors upon the bills
assigned to them from 20 to 40 per cent. These
and other similar lying accusations were some of
them pronounced by both Houses of Parliament to
be 'false and scandalous;' whilst others were promptly
and thoroughly disposed of in a pamphlet written by
Walpole; but the slanderous scribblers, and still
more the irresponsible advisers and gossips round
Anne's toilet-table and at her music-parties, on
whom the Queen had latterly taken a fancy for relying,
did to some extent attain their end by discrediting
for a while her responsible Ministers.</p>

<p>And here it should be said that Godolphin, though
a Tory at heart&mdash;for 'a Whig was his aversion'&mdash;at
once discerned the rising genius of Walpole, favoured
him with his protection, and recommended him to
Marlborough; and, when our great statesman was
dying, he said to the Duchess of Marlborough, who
stood by his bedside, 'If you ever forsake that young
man, and if souls are permitted to return from the
grave to the earth, I will appear to you and reproach
you for your conduct.'</p>

<p>Both Marlborough and Godolphin loudly and
vehemently protested against the line of conduct
which Anne had adopted in slighting their counsels,
whilst she, with characteristic sturdiness, refused
to listen to their reproofs and entreaties. Wyon
gives a letter from Godolphin to the Queen on
the subject of the appointment of the Duke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
Shrewsbury (the 'King of Hearts') <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice</i> the Marquis
of Kent, as Chamberlain&mdash;the like of which, he
thinks, can scarcely ever before have been addressed
to a sovereign by one of her subjects, observing
that 'He reproached her in round terms for permitting
herself to be directed by a private ministry.
Her conduct, he said, would draw ruin upon
herself and the kingdom, and would force every
man in the Council, except the Duke of Somerset, to
run from it as he would from the plague. He put it
to her what effect an entire change of Ministers
was likely to have upon her allies abroad, and
whether the war was likely to be carried on well by
people who had been averse to it from the beginning.'
Nevertheless, Godolphin loyally assured the Queen
that, whatever course she determined to adopt, never
would he in any way offer the least obstruction to
her or to her Ministers.</p>

<p>Need it be added that after passages such as these
the star of Godolphin paled? To what avail was it
that, in 1706, he had been made Earl of Godolphin
and Viscount Rialton? His life was a burden to
him, as we have already seen; he was sick of the
popularity which Sacheverell's<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> violent diatribes
against the Government had secured for him; and
he was weary of the intrigues of the discontented
Whigs, and the taunts and sneers of the ultra-Tories.
His nerves were shattered from constantly walking
among many pitfalls; his mind was distracted by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
irksome dilemmas with which he had for so long a
time been compelled to deal; and he could no longer
brook the black, unforgiving looks of his royal mistress.
Yet he might have truly exclaimed, as Sir
Robert Walpole did of himself afterwards, 'My
crime is my long continuance in office: in other
words, the long exclusion of those who now combine
against me.' Was it a greater relief to him or to
her when, in August, 1710, the Queen dismissed
Godolphin from his post, and desired him, according
to one account, that 'instead of bringing the
Staff of Office to her, he would <em>break</em> it, as easier to
them both.' Swift says that in doing so, the Earl
flung the pieces into the fire, an act which greatly
annoyed the Queen. And with Godolphin fell his
son&mdash;then Cofferer to the Household&mdash;and his son's
wife, the Lady Henrietta, one of the Ladies of the
Queen's Bedchamber.</p>

<p>The time had come at length for Harley and St.
John to reap the fruits of their triumph; and, though
Marlborough<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> had more than once warded off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
blow&mdash;not only for the sake of the friendship and the
family ties<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> which had so long subsisted between him
and the Minister, but for the sake of Queen and
country&mdash;that blow fell at last. But the result was
terrible also to the financial credit of England. The
Treasury was put into commission; and vast was the
commotion in Change Alley. Bank shares at once
fell from 140 to 110, and soon to 106; whilst the
Bank refused a loan of £400,000 to the new Government.
'That Godolphin should retire,' wrote Marlborough
to his Duchess on 1st October, 1706, 'is
impossible, unless it be resolved that everything
must go ill abroad, as well as at home; for, without
flattery, his reputation is as great in all Courts as well
as at home; that such a step would go a great way
with Holland, in particular, to make their peace with
France, which at this time must be fatal to the
liberties of Europe.'</p>

<p>Then came the Report of the Commissioners of
Public Accounts (17th March, 1711-12), in which they
stated, but did not dare to <em>print</em> their statement, that
there were certain irregularities in the dealings of the
English with the Scotch Treasury; and Godolphin's
oath was confronted by another to the contrary from
the Earl of Glasgow. Burnet describes this affair
as an effusion of 'Tory malice,' and adds that 'the
Earl of Godolphin's unblemished integrity was such
that no imputation of any sort could be fastened
upon him.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>To what could all this misery tend but to the
breaking up of a constitution never one of the
strongest,&mdash;and to the 'last scene of all, that ends
this strange, eventful history'? Sidney Godolphin
died, after a long and excruciating illness, at the
Duke of Marlborough's house near St. Albans, on the
15th September, 1712, in the sixty-eighth year of his
age; and his death so deeply affected Marlborough,
that he left his native country, which had been as
ungrateful to him as to his dearest friend, to live
'beyond sea.'</p>

<p>Four Dukes&mdash;namely, Richmond, Schomberg,
Devonshire, and Marlborough&mdash;were the pall-bearers
when the remains of one of our most illustrious
Cornishmen were interred at night in Westminster
Abbey. Here, in the south aisle of the nave, his
monument was raised by his daughter-in-law, Lady
Henrietta Churchill, who, in default of male issue,
afterwards became Duchess of Marlborough, on her
father's death in 1722, and who found a resting-place
within the same venerable walls, twenty-one years
afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Of her husband, Francis, the second
and last Earl of Godolphin, there is nothing of much
importance to record;<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> the history of the Godolphins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>may be said to end with that of the illustrious Sidney.
Yet from the union, in 1698, of the second Earl
and Lady Henrietta, some of our noblest families
derive their ancestry. Anne, then Princess, offered
in the most delicate terms to endow the bride
with a marriage portion of £10,000, but could
not prevail upon the Lady Henrietta's parents to
accept more than half that sum; they contributing
£5,000 themselves.</p>

<p>One daughter, named after her mother, Henrietta,
married Thomas, Duke of Newcastle, but they had
no offspring. The correspondence between the
Duchess of Marlborough and Sir John Vanbrugh on
the subject of the marriage between Lady Henrietta
Godolphin and the Duke of Newcastle, forms an
appendix to the second volume of Mrs. Thomson's
'Memoirs of the Duchess of Marlborough.' Lady
Henrietta had £22,000 to her portion, procured by
the Duchess, according to her own account. But
for all sorts of small family gossip, often of an
amusing nature, the Egerton and Additional MSS.
in the British Museum should be consulted&mdash;especially
Additional MSS. 28,052.</p>

<p>The Lady Mary Godolphin, eventually sole heiress
of the family, married Thomas Osborne, fourth Duke
of Leeds, and from them sprang an illustrious
succession, which it hardly falls within my province
to describe; a similar remark applies to
members of other branches of the family. The
name of Godolphin has, however, been carefully
retained by those in whose veins Godolphin blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
still flows; as in the cases of Francis, fifth son of
the Duke of Leeds, and Baron Godolphin; Lord
Sidney Godolphin Osborne, who died in 1861;
and in those of more than one Duke of Leeds,
including the ninth and present Duke, George
Godolphin.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A portrait bust adorns Godolphin's marble cenotaph
in the south aisle of the nave at Westminster; and
there is also a fine portrait of the Great Minister,
by Sir Godfrey Kneller, in the collection of the Earl
of St. Germans, of which J. Smith has scraped a
mezzotint. They both convey the impression which
the story of his life would lead one to expect.
Thoughtfulness, reserve mingled with sadness, and
power, were the chief characteristics of his countenance
as of his career. And a like reticence seems
to have influenced biographical writers; for, so far as
I am aware, there is no good monograph life of
Sidney Godolphin. His gloomy expression was
notorious; it procured for him more than one
nickname, and has been handed down to us in
grey-eyed, savage-faced, 'miserrimus' Swift's line:</p>

<p class="center small">'And wine cheers up Godolphin's cloudy face.'<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>I do not, however, believe that there is any reason
for supposing that he drank to excess. For literature
and the fine arts he cared little; but he was a devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
and successful admirer of the fair sex&mdash;notwithstanding
the personal drawback of his face being much
disfigured by small-pox; and Swift tells us that
Godolphin would 'sometimes scratch out a song in
praise of his mistress, with his pencil and card.' His
devoted and romantic admiration of Mary of Modena
was a frequent subject of remark; and he was
always sending her little presents 'such as ladies
love.' Gamble, he certainly did; but it has been
said, by himself as well as by Burnet, that he took
to cards so much as he did, in order to avoid the
necessity of talking&mdash;a thing which he detested
having to do. Cock-fighting and horse-racing were
very favourite amusements with him, as with so
many others of that time; and at Newmarket, during
the racing season, he used to keep open house. His
son seems to have had a similar love for the turf; and
to the latter we are indebted for the introduction into
England of the famous Godolphin Arab. This horse
had a curious history. He was presented by some
Arab chief to Louis XIV., but was not admired by
the French Monarch, and was ultimately condemned
to cart-work; but the keeper of an English coffee
tavern recognised the merits of the animal, brought
him to England, and sold him to Godolphin.</p>

<p>The details of the great Minister's sporting expenditure
were known only to himself; it was
generally believed that he won, both on the turf and
at the card-table; but this at least is certain, that,
notwithstanding his long tenure of office, and his
having been left £5,000 a year by his brother, Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
William, he died very poor; indeed, the Duchess
of Marlborough endorsed on his letter of dismissal
from his office, that Sidney Godolphin, Lord High
Treasurer of England, left scarcely enough money
to pay his funeral expenses. The following is the
endorsement referred to:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Had not his elder brother happened to die, he
had been in very low circumstances after having
been in several reigns for more than twenty years,
though he was a man that never made any great
expenses, for he won at play, and mortally hated all
kinds of show and grandeur, but he was very
charitable and generous; and though he had lived
so long, and had great employments, when he died
he had not in the world but about £14,000 in tallies,
of which sum seven was mine, three Mrs. Rundal's,
a thousand Mrs. Curtis's (a woman that looked after
my two elder children), and many other small sums
that he took of helpless people who thought themselves
safe in his hands; and when all his debts
were paid there could hardly be enough to bury him.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p class="noindent">It may not be out of place to note here, that Mrs.
A. T. Thomson has vindicated, in a most spirited
and successful manner, the charge, brought by some
of the scandalmongers of the day, of a liaison
between the Duchess and Godolphin.</p>

<p>And yet, notwithstanding his own poverty, so far
as regarded the public weal hardly ever was there a
statesman of more reliable, cool judgment, or a
more skilled political economist; nor did anyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
possess in a higher degree, says Mr. Wyon, the then
rare virtue of incorruptible integrity.</p>

<p>Although Godolphin had been the trusted Minister
of Sovereigns of so various temperaments&mdash;holding
his own with them all&mdash;yet that he was no sycophant
or hypocrite is clear from his having run counter to
the wishes of both Charles II. and James II., by
voting for the Exclusion Bill, and by favouring the
suggestion of a Regency even when the accession of
William III. seemed inevitable. Men seemed to
have felt that in Godolphin's hands they were safe.
We have seen the effect which his fall produced
amongst the financiers of London; and in the concluding
sentence of one of Evelyn's letters (addressed
though it was to Godolphin himself) we find, what
is no doubt a true echo of the regard in which he
was generally held:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">
<span class="padl-3"> * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</span><br />

<p>'In such a tempest and overgrown a sea, everybody
is concerned, and whose head is not ready to
turne? I am sure, I should myselfe almost despaire
of the vessel, if any, save your Lordship, were at the
helme. But, whilst your hand is on the staff, and
your eye upon the star, I compose myselfe and rest
secure.</p>

<p class="small">'Surrey Street, 16th June, 1696.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>Well might Swift write in one of his letters to
Stella, dated 18th Sept., 1712: 'The Whigs have
lost a great support in the Earl of Godolphin. It is
a good jest to hear the Ministers talk of him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
humanity and pity, because he is dead, <em>and can do
them no more hurt</em>.' Lady Henrietta Godolphin
never forgave Swift for his way of writing about her
father-in-law. She, as we have seen, cut him at a
card-party at Lady Clarges', just as sturdy, honest
Dr. Johnson cut him in the street.</p>

<p>Godolphin's character has thus been sketched by
another hand; and with it the name and the fame
of Sidney Godolphin will always be indissolubly
joined: 'He was of quick apprehension and wonderful
dispatch; almost unerring judgment  ... of
few words, but great Truth: few promises but strict
performance  ... by nature grave, reserved and
taciturn, but without arrogance or scorn of others;
and when he most relaxed and let himself into the
greatest freedoms, they were such as might be told
abroad without any hazard of his fame or Virtue.'</p>

<p>Bishop Burnet has thus summed up his character
and career:</p>

<p class="p1-5" />
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'He was a Man of the clearest Head, the calmest
Temper, and the most incorrupt of all the Ministers
of State I have ever known. After having been
thirty Years in the Treasury, and during Nine of
those Lord Treasurer, as he was never once suspected
of Corruption, or of suffering his Servants to
grow rich under him, so in all that time his Estate
was not increased by him to the Value of 4000<em>l</em>.
He served the Queen with such a particular Affection
and Zeal, that he studied to possess all People
with great personal esteem for her: And she herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
seemed to be so sensible of this for many Years, that
if Courts were not different from all other Places in
the World, it might have been thought that his wise
Management at home, and the Duke of Marlborough's
glorious Conduct abroad, would have
fixed them in their Posts, above the little Practices
of an artful Favourite.'</p></div>

<p class="p1-5" />
<p>But Courts <em>are</em> different from other places; and we
have seen that in the Court of Anne, the memory of
Godolphin's virtues was 'written on water.' Had
he lived but two years longer he might, like Marlborough,
have once more been restored to Royal
favour at the Court of George I., and in yet another
reign have been again the First Minister of the
Crown of England.</p>

the neighbourhood of Godolphin seems to have been the birthplace of
many important mining inventions. Near here the first steam-engine
for draining the mine was put to work, early in the present century, at
Wheal Vor; and the following is recorded in the Register of Breage
Church: 'James Epsley sen<sup>r</sup> of Chilchampton Parish Bath and Wells

had suffered from the attacks of his assailants. Green, in his 'Short
History of the English People,' says: 'In the bitter moments before his
fall, he bade <em>Godolphin</em> burn some querulous letters which the persecution
of his opponents had wrung from him. 'My desire is that the
world may continue in their error of thinking me a happy man, for I
think it better to be envied than pitied.' Yet he could write philosophically
enough, and in somewhat similar vein, from Tirlemount, to his
irritated Duchess, who had been deeply stung by one of the many
libellous pamphlets which were now making their appearance: 'The
best way of putting an end to that villany is not to appear concerned.
The best of men and women in all ages have been ill-used. If we can
be so happy as to behave ourselves so as to have no reason to reproach
ourselves, we may then despise what rage and faction do.'</p></div>
